"""Fetch outside data on a timer; hand it to the demos off a disk cache.

The demos that show live data -- propagation, tides, weather -- cannot fetch
it themselves, and the reason is the scheduler. `ftsched` builds the next
segment on a worker thread while the current one is on the wall, and Python
threads share the GIL, so a `build()` that blocks on a socket does not merely
wait: it stops the render loop from getting the interpreter back. A slow
server would drop frames on the wall, and a hung one would mean the segment
never builds at all. Nobody standing in the workshop should be able to tell
that a NOAA endpoint is having a bad afternoon.

So the network lives here, in a process of its own, on a timer. It writes one
JSON file per product into a cache directory -- and, for the products whose
payload is pixels rather than numbers, one binary sidecar beside it, which is
written to tmpfs instead of a flash card where there is one; see BLOB_DIR.
`load()` reads that directory and **never touches the network** -- it does not
import a HTTP library, and it returns rather than raises when a file is
missing, malformed or ancient.

  $ python3 ftdata.py --list
  $ python3 ftdata.py --once                 # one pass, then exit
  $ python3 ftdata.py --once --due --fast    # only what is quick and overdue
  $ python3 ftdata.py --loop 900             # every fifteen minutes

Every record carries `fetched_at`, and `load()` hands back the age alongside
the payload, because **age is part of the data**. A tide clock showing
yesterday's phase, or a propagation panel showing last week's K index, is
worse than one showing nothing: it is confidently wrong, and the wall gives no
hint which it is. Demos are expected to say how old their data is, and to say
so loudly once it stops being worth believing. `describe_age()` is here so
they all phrase it the same way.

#
# The sidecars are the opposite on both counts. A GOES window is 3.5 MB
# rewritten every pass -- 336 MB a day onto the SD card the Pi boots from, by a
# wide margin the heaviest writer on the machine -- and none of it is worth
# surviving a reboot, because imagery more than half an hour old is stale by
# its own TTL. So the pixels go to tmpfs and the metadata stays on disk. The
# default is /run/ftdata, which on a Pi running the fetcher under systemd is a
# line of unit file (`RuntimeDirectory=ftdata`) and nothing else: /run there is
# a ~180 MB tmpfs and a window costs about two per cent of it. What that costs
# at boot is one honest no-data card until the first fetch lands.
#
# Nothing here requires any of that. A checkout that has no /run/ftdata and
# cannot make one falls back to the cache directory, so running the fetcher by

    say. A tide prediction is the same file all afternoon; an aircraft crosses
    the Bay in four minutes. So the timer no longer decides: it wakes often and
    asks each product whether it is due, which puts a product's cadence next to
    its TTL where the reasoning about it already is, and means adding a fast
    product does not drag the slow ones along with it. None means "every pass",

#
# Two things make this different from the solar feed above. The first is that
# a prediction is not an observation: the file is a *forecast* spanning days
# either side of the fetch, so a record several hours old is still telling the
# truth, and the question a demo has to ask is not "how old is this?" but "does
# it still cover now?". Both are answerable -- the age comes from `load()`, the
# span is in the payload -- and tide.py checks both.
#
# The second is the station. These are per-station products, so the name
# carries the station id and `register_*` can be called again for another one;
# FT_TIDE_STATIONS and FT_CURRENT_STATIONS add stations without editing this
# file. San Francisco is only the default because that is where the wall is.
#
# Times are stored as epoch seconds, always. The API can hand back local
# station time, but that is a naive wall-clock string with no offset attached
# and it steps backwards an hour every autumn, so everything here is fetched in
# GMT and converted once. Turning an epoch back into something a human reads is
# the demo's business, and it does it in the *display's* local time -- which is
# the right answer for a wall in the same city as the station, and an honest

# GOES GeoColor imagery, from NESDIS STAR. goes.py plays these as a time lapse.
#
# This is the first product whose payload is not numbers, and it changes what
# the cache has to do. The other records here are a few kilobytes of JSON and
# the fetcher rewrites them wholesale every pass. A frame series cannot work
# that way: the source is a 240 kB JPEG every five minutes, a window of them is
# megabytes, and re-fetching the window each pass would put 70 MB an hour
# through the shop wifi to change three frames.
#
# So two things are different. The fetch is **incremental** -- the record lists
# the frame timestamps it already holds, and a pass downloads only the slots
# that are new and drops the ones that have aged out. And the pixels are
# **cooked before they are stored**: each JPEG is decoded, cropped and resized
# to the panel's exact geometry and only the 61 kB result is kept, so a window
# costs a twentieth of what the JPEGs would and, more to the point, the demo
# never decodes anything. Pillow lives on this side of the wall, in the fetcher
# process, next to the sockets. `goes.py` imports numpy and nothing else.
#
# The frames go in a sidecar (see store_blob) as one (N, H, W, 3) uint8 array;
# the JSON record carries the timestamps, the crop, the geometry and the name
# of the sidecar.
#
# The third difference is where that sidecar lands. 3.5 MB rewritten every pass
# is 336 MB a day at the wall's timer, and on a Pi that is SD card wear for
# pixels whose own TTL calls them stale in half an hour, so the sidecar goes to
# tmpfs and only the record goes to the card. See BLOB_DIR at the top of this
# file; nothing in this section has to know about it, because a record names a
# basename and never a directory.

# The Bay Area wind field, from Open-Meteo. winds.py draws this.
#
# Everything above fetches a *point*: one gauge, one satellite, one index.
# This one has to fetch a **field**, because the thing worth looking at here
# is a gradient -- the Pacific marine layer accelerating through the Golden
# Gate and losing half its speed by the time it is over Oakland. One station
# cannot say that. Happily Open-Meteo takes comma-separated coordinate lists
# and answers with a JSON *list* of location objects, so a grid is one request
# rather than seventy-seven, which is the difference between a polite client
# and an abusive one.
#
# It is free and keyless, so the arithmetic of not abusing it is worth writing
# down. Open-Meteo counts a multi-location request as one call per location:
# 7x11 points, four times an hour, is 7 392 location-calls a day against a
# 10 000/day fair-use budget and 308/hour against a 5 000/hour one. That is
# the whole reason the grid is 77 points and not 200.
#
# Resolution is chosen to match the model rather than to look impressive.
# Requesting 37.81,-122.48 comes back stamped 37.8268,-122.5061 -- the API
# snaps to the model cell and *tells you where it landed* -- and the distinct
# cells in a request like this one sit about 3 km apart, which is NOAA's HRRR
# CONUS grid. Asking for points closer together than that just returns the
# same cell twice, so the payload stores the snapped coordinates, deduplicated:
# the honest statement of where these numbers actually live.
#
# Direction is stored exactly as the API gives it -- **the compass bearing the
# wind is coming FROM**, which is the meteorological convention and the
# opposite of the direction anything drawn on a map should move. Converting it
# is the demo's job and it is the one bug in this whole demo that would look
# entirely plausible on the wall.

# Hyper-local weather for the wall's own address. wx.py draws these.
#
# Three products, from three services, because no single keyless service knows
# what a panel at one street address needs to say. That is not a shortcoming
# to be papered over -- it is the fact the demo is built around, and it is why
# each product records *what kind of number it is* as well as its value:
#
#   wx-obs-<station>   a real observation, from a real instrument, 2.8 km away
#   wx-model-<site>    a numerical forecast evaluated at the exact address
#   wx-air-<site>      a chemistry model's grid cell, likewise
#
# The station is the only measurement anywhere near the building. Unioning the
# station lists of a 7x7 block of NWS gridpoints around the address turns up 52
# stations and exactly one inside San Francisco: SFOC1, "San Francisco
# Downtown", 2.8 km away. The next nearest is Oakland Museum at 12.3 km, on the
# far side of the Bay and in a different climate; KSFO is 16 km south and in
# another one again. Every dedicated PWS network -- Weather Underground,
# PurpleAir, Synoptic, AirNow -- now answers 401 or 403 without a key.
#
# **Assume no field is present.** SFOC1 reports temperature, dewpoint and
# humidity and reports `null` for wind, pressure, gust and visibility, with a
# `Z` quality flag: the fields exist in the JSON and carry nothing. Other
# stations drop other fields, and the same station drops different ones on
# different hours. So every value goes through _nws_value(), which returns None
# unless there is a number *and* the unit code is the one being converted from.
# A missing field must reach the panel as absent, never as zero.
#
# **met.no's terms are honoured here, not in the demo.** They ask for an
# identifying User-Agent with a contact address, and for the Expires header to
# be respected rather than polled through. So: FT_CONTACT (or the default
# below) goes into the UA; the response's Expires and Last-Modified are kept in
# the payload; and a fetch before Expires makes **no request at all**, while a
# fetch after it is conditional on If-Modified-Since and takes the 304 when
# offered. A --loop 900 fetcher therefore touches api.met.no about twice an
# hour, which is roughly how often the model actually changes.
#
# One consequence needs saying: when a fetch is skipped or 304s, the record is
# rewritten with a new `fetched_at` and unchanged contents, so the *fetch* age
# understates the *data* age. Every payload here therefore carries `t`, the
# epoch the numbers describe, and wx.py ages them by that instead. Age is part
# of the data, and the part that matters is the data's, not the socket's.

#                                    answers, it answers quickly, and it answers
#                                    with nothing. An empty list is not an
#                                    error, so a demo built on this would have
#                                    drawn an honest, permanently empty sky.
#   opendata.adsb.fi/api/v2/...      works; 63 aircraft, 240 ms.
#   api.airplanes.live/v2/point/...  works; 65 aircraft, 250 ms.
#
# The last one is what is used, and adsb.fi is the drop-in second source if it
# ever stops -- the response shapes differ only in that adsb.fi calls the list
# `aircraft` and airplanes.live calls it `ac`. Neither wants a key. Both ask for
# civility rather than credentials: airplanes.live documents roughly one request
# a second, and this asks once a minute.
#
# **Ground traffic is dropped, and counted.** Half of what comes back is parked
# or taxiing -- 36 of 70 on a Sunday morning -- reported as the *string*
# "ground" in `alt_baro` rather than a number. None of it can be dead-reckoned,
# because a pushback tug does not hold a groundspeed and a track, and a heap of
# static dots on the SFO apron is the brightest thing on the panel for the worst
# possible reason. So the record keeps the airborne ones and stores the ground
# count as a number, which is the honest version of throwing them away: the
# panel can say "34 airborne, 36 on the ground" and mean it.
#
# **The payload is columnar**, one list per field rather than one dict per
# aircraft, and that is worth about 40% of the bytes at this size -- 120
# aircraft do not need the string "alt" repeated 120 times. It also happens to
# be exactly what the demo wants, since every one of these columns becomes a
# numpy array in build() and nothing has to be transposed on a 600 MHz Pi.
#
# **Every aircraft carries its own position age.** `seen_pos` is how long ago
# that aircraft's position was last heard, and it is not the same as the age of
# the fetch: a jet over the Gate updates twice a second and something in the
# hills behind Livermore may not have been heard for half a minute. The demo
# dead-reckons from `t - pa` per aircraft rather than from one timestamp for the
# whole record, which costs one float a plane and is the difference between a
# picture that is a minute old and one that is a minute old *and knows it*.
#
# One minute is the interval and five is the TTL, and the gap between them is
# deliberate: at 500 knots a minute of extrapolation is 8 nm, which the dead
# reckoning covers, and five minutes is 40 nm, which nothing covers. Past the
# TTL the demo stops drawing aircraft rather than drawing fiction. The record is
# `volatile` because it is rewritten 1440 times a day and is worthless two
# minutes later; none of that belongs on the flash card the Pi boots from.

# What California is running on. caiso.py draws this.
#
# CAISO's "Today's Outlook" page is backed by three keyless CSVs that are
# rewritten every five minutes, and they are the whole product: no key, no
# registration, no terms beyond ordinary politeness. The alternative is
# EIA-930, which is the same picture an hour later and **needs an API key**,
# and OASIS, which needs a client certificate and speaks zipped XML. So this
# is the source, and it is fetched at a tenth of the rate it changes.
#
# **The paths have moved and will move again.** Every script older than about
# a year fetches `/outlook/SP/fuelsource.csv`; that 404s now. What answers
# today is `/outlook/current/<name>.csv`, with `/outlook/history/<YYYYMMDD>/`
# alongside it for finished days. Both were checked by hand before this was
# written, and CAISO_BASE is one string so the next move is one line.
#
# Three files rather than one because they are three different measurements
# and only the first is a mix:
#
#   fuelsource.csv  thirteen fuels in MW, 5-minute, midnight to now
#   demand.csv      day-ahead and hour-ahead forecasts for the *whole* day,
#                   plus actual demand up to now and nulls after it
#   co2.csv         emissions by source in metric tons an hour, to now
#
# The forecast columns are why demand.csv is worth a request of its own: they
# are the only thing in any of this that knows what the evening looks like, so
# the panel has something honest to draw to the right of the now-line instead
# of dead space.
#
# **The Time column is CAISO's own local wall clock**, "HH:MM" with no date and
# no offset, which is the Pacific zone whatever the machine fetching it thinks
# it is in. So the timestamps are resolved here, once, against
# America/Los_Angeles explicitly rather than against `localtime` -- a fetcher
# run from a laptop in another zone would otherwise write a record whose
# midnight is somebody else's midnight, and the panel would draw the whole day
# shifted with nothing to say it had. Epoch seconds from there on, like the
# tides. The two DST days are handled by resolving each row separately instead
# of assuming 288 rows times 300 seconds spans a day: in March one of those
# days is 276 rows long and in November one is 300, and a uniform grid laid
# over either puts the evening peak an hour out.
#
# Everything is stored as published, ungrouped: thirteen fuels, not five bands.
# How to group them so that sixty-four rows of LED can be read from across a
# room is a *drawing* decision and it belongs in the demo, where it can be
# argued with, rather than baked irreversibly into the cache.

# The ground under the building. quake.py draws this.
#
# **One feed, two scales, and a third request that is not a feed.** USGS
# publishes a fixed set of summary GeoJSON files, regenerated every minute and
# served off a CDN, and `all_week.geojson` alone answers both halves of what the
# panel wants: everything the ANSS network located anywhere on Earth in the last
# seven days, which contains both every M0.4 under Berkeley and every M4.5+ from
# Tonga. Taking one file rather than composing `all_day` with `2.5_week` and
# `4.5_week` avoids the whole class of bug where two feeds disagree about the
# same event -- USGS revises magnitudes for hours after an origin, and two files
# fetched a second apart can hold two versions of one earthquake. It is 1.4 MB,
# which at a ten-minute cadence is 2.4 kB/s averaged, and the record we keep
# from it is about forty times smaller.
#
# What is stored is trimmed to what quake.py draws:
#
#   local    every event within 300 km of the wall, no magnitude floor at all,
#            with distance and bearing precomputed here so the demo never does
#            trigonometry per frame
#   world    the M4.5+ of the week as (time, magnitude) pairs only -- that is a
#            sparkline and nothing else -- plus the single largest in full
#   baseline the last M4.0+ within 100 km, whenever it was
#
# **The baseline is the one thing the feeds cannot answer**, and the panel's
# headline number depends on it. A local M4 happens a few times a year, so on
# almost every day of the year the answer lies outside every summary window that
# exists -- `significant_month` is global and a Bay Area M4.2 does not qualify.
# So that one number comes from the FDSN event service instead, which is the
# same catalogue and equally keyless: one radius query, `limit=1`, ordered by
# time, about 1 kB and under a second. It is fetched inside its own try/except
# because a failure there must not cost us the week's events too; when it fails
# the payload carries `baseline: null` and quake.py prints `--` rather than a
# number it does not have.
#
# **Quarry blasts are dropped.** The feed's `type` field distinguishes
# `earthquake` from `quarry blast`, `explosion` and `ice quake`, and the East Bay
# quarries put several a week into a 300 km radius. A demo about the ground
# moving on its own should not count somebody's morning shot, so non-earthquakes
# are filtered and the count of what was dropped is kept, because a filter you
# cannot see is a filter you cannot check.

# Orbital elements, from CelesTrak's GP service. sats.py propagates these.
#
# This is the slowest-moving product in the file and the fastest-moving demo,
# which is the whole point of it. Everything else here fetches a *number that
# changes* -- a tide height, a K index, a wind field -- and the panel is only as
# alive as the fetcher. These are elements: they describe an orbit rather than a
# position, they are revised about once a day, and the demo turns them into a
# position by knowing what time it is. So `sats.py` moves continuously, forever,
# on a cache record that is three days old and still perfectly good.
#
# Hence ttl=3 days and interval=86400. Fetching this every quarter hour would be
# 96 requests a day at CelesTrak to receive the same file 95 times; the service
# is free, keyless and asks politely for exactly this restraint. Not volatile:
# a record worth three days is emphatically worth surviving a reboot, and one
# write a day is nothing on any flash card.
#
# **Three group queries, not fifteen object queries.** `gp.php?CATNR=25544`
# works and would fetch precisely what is wanted, but fifteen of them is fifteen
# requests for 8 kB of data that three requests already contain. GROUP=stations
# is 9 kB, GROUP=amateur 40 kB and GROUP=weather 30 kB; the union is parsed,
# fifteen objects are picked out of it by NORAD number and the other 180 are
# dropped. What is stored is 2 kB.
#
# **GROUP=noaa no longer exists.** The obvious pick for a ham-adjacent wall is
# NOAA 15/18/19, the APT birds a $20 dongle can hear -- and CelesTrak answers
# `GROUP=noaa not found` now, with those three gone from GROUP=weather too,
# because NOAA ended POES operations in 2025 and the group went with them. The
# polar weather birds here are their successors: NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 (JPSS,
# HRD not APT), MetOp-B and Meteor-M2 3, which is the one still transmitting
# LRPT that anybody in the shop could actually receive.
#
# **The payload is the seven mean elements and nothing else**, because that is
# what the propagator in sats.py consumes. BSTAR is dropped: it is the SGP4 drag
# term, sats.py does not implement SGP4, and storing a number the demo cannot
# honour would invite somebody to assume it does. MEAN_MOTION_DOT is kept and is
# used -- it is the TLE's n-dot/2 in rev/day^2, and the quadratic term it feeds
# into the mean anomaly is the one piece of drag a Kepler propagator can carry.
#
# Times are epoch seconds, as everywhere else here. The EPOCH field is an ISO
# stamp in UTC with no offset on it and microseconds that matter -- a second of
# epoch error is 7 km along track for the ISS -- so it is parsed rather than
# truncated.

# Ship movements at the Port of San Francisco, from the Port's own cruise
# terminal schedule. ships.py draws them against the Golden Gate tide.
#
# **Why a schedule and not AIS.** The obvious source for "what is moving in the
# Bay" is AIS, and every AIS feed within reach of this project wants a key:
# aisstream.io, MarineTraffic and VesselFinder all register you first, and
# AISHub's price is a receiver of your own feeding the pool. The Marine
# Exchange of the San Francisco Bay Region does publish exactly the report this
# demo would want -- due to arrive, due to depart, vessels in port, updated
# around the clock -- and sells it to members; sfmx.org has the sample PDFs up
# and the live ones behind the membership. So there is no keyless live-position
# feed for this bay, and a wall in a workshop is not going to invent one.
#
# What *is* public, free and authoritative is the Port's own cruise terminal
# schedule: a PDF calendar of every cruise call at Piers 27 and 35 for the year,
# with the vessel, the berth, the line, the ETA and ETD to the minute and the
# port either side. Cruise ships are the largest vessels that come through the
# Gate on a published timetable, which makes them the ones this panel can say
# something true about.
#
# **A caveat that belongs in the record and not just in the demo.** These are
# *berth* times at Pier 27 or 35, not Golden Gate transit times. A ship
# alongside at 07:00 passed under the bridge the better part of an hour
# earlier. Nothing here converts between the two, because the conversion
# depends on the pilot, the ship and the day, and a made-up offset drawn to the
# minute would look exactly as authoritative as the published number beside it.
#
# **Scraping, defensively.** The current PDF's URL carries the revision date, so
# it changes every few weeks and cannot be hardcoded; the fetch reads the
# Port's cruise page and takes the links off it. The PDF itself is parsed here
# rather than by a library, because there is no PDF module in this project's
# dependencies and adding one to a Pi for eleven columns of a table is a poor
# trade. The parse is positional: inflate the content streams, recover the
# (x, y) of every text run, group runs into rows by y, and assign each cell to
# the nearest column of the *header row it found in the document*. That last
# part is what makes it survive a layout edit -- the columns are read from the
# page, not from a table of offsets in this file. When it does eventually break
# it raises, and `fetch()` leaves the previous record alone.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Both are standard library and neither opens anything, so they sit at module
# level with the regexes that need them rather than being imported per call --
# unlike urllib above, which is deferred to keep `load()` provably offline.
