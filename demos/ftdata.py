"""Fetch outside data on a timer; hand it to the demos off a disk cache.

The demos that show live data -- propagation, tides, weather -- cannot fetch
it themselves, and the reason is the scheduler. `ftsched` builds the next
segment on a worker thread while the current one is on the wall, and Python
threads share the GIL, so a `build()` that blocks on a socket does not merely
wait: it stops the render loop from getting the interpreter back. A slow
server would drop frames on the wall, and a hung one would mean the segment
never builds at all. Nobody standing in the workshop should be able to tell
that a NOAA endpoint is having a bad afternoon.

So the network lives here, in a process of its own, on a timer. It writes one
JSON file per product into a cache directory. `load()` reads that directory
and **never touches the network** -- it does not import a HTTP library, and it
returns rather than raises when a file is missing, malformed or ancient.

  $ python3 ftdata.py --list
  $ python3 ftdata.py --once                 # one pass, then exit
  $ python3 ftdata.py --loop 900             # every fifteen minutes

Every record carries `fetched_at`, and `load()` hands back the age alongside
the payload, because **age is part of the data**. A tide clock showing
yesterday's phase, or a propagation panel showing last week's K index, is
worse than one showing nothing: it is confidently wrong, and the wall gives no
hint which it is. Demos are expected to say how old their data is, and to say
so loudly once it stops being worth believing. `describe_age()` is here so
they all phrase it the same way.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hyper-local weather for the wall's own address. wx.py draws these.
#
# Three products, from three services, because no single keyless service knows
# what a panel on 18th Street needs to say. That is not a shortcoming to be
# papered over -- it is the fact the demo is built around, and it is why each
# product records *what kind of number it is* as well as its value:
#
#   wx-obs-<station>   a real observation, from a real instrument, 2.8 km away
#   wx-model-<site>    a numerical forecast evaluated at the exact address
#   wx-air-<site>      a chemistry model's grid cell, likewise
#
# The station is the only measurement anywhere near the building. Unioning the
# station lists of a 7x7 block of NWS gridpoints around the address turns up 52
# stations and exactly one inside San Francisco: SFOC1, "San Francisco
# Downtown", 2.8 km away. The next nearest is Oakland Museum at 12.3 km, on the
# far side of the Bay and in a different climate; KSFO is 16 km south and in
# another one again. Every dedicated PWS network -- Weather Underground,
# PurpleAir, Synoptic, AirNow -- now answers 401 or 403 without a key.
#
# **Assume no field is present.** SFOC1 reports temperature, dewpoint and
# humidity and reports `null` for wind, pressure, gust and visibility, with a
# `Z` quality flag: the fields exist in the JSON and carry nothing. Other
# stations drop other fields, and the same station drops different ones on
# different hours. So every value goes through _nws_value(), which returns None
# unless there is a number *and* the unit code is the one being converted from.
# A missing field must reach the panel as absent, never as zero.
#
# **met.no's terms are honoured here, not in the demo.** They ask for an
# identifying User-Agent with a contact address, and for the Expires header to
# be respected rather than polled through. So: FT_CONTACT (or the default
# below) goes into the UA; the response's Expires and Last-Modified are kept in
# the payload; and a fetch before Expires makes **no request at all**, while a
# fetch after it is conditional on If-Modified-Since and takes the 304 when
# offered. A --loop 900 fetcher therefore touches api.met.no about twice an
# hour, which is roughly how often the model actually changes.
#
# One consequence needs saying: when a fetch is skipped or 304s, the record is
# rewritten with a new `fetched_at` and unchanged contents, so the *fetch* age
# understates the *data* age. Every payload here therefore carries `t`, the
# epoch the numbers describe, and wx.py ages them by that instead. Age is part
# of the data, and the part that matters is the data's, not the socket's.
