"""Fetch outside data on a timer; hand it to the demos off a disk cache.

The demos that show live data -- propagation, tides, weather -- cannot fetch
it themselves, and the reason is the scheduler. `ftsched` builds the next
segment on a worker thread while the current one is on the wall, and Python
threads share the GIL, so a `build()` that blocks on a socket does not merely
wait: it stops the render loop from getting the interpreter back. A slow
server would drop frames on the wall, and a hung one would mean the segment
never builds at all. Nobody standing in the workshop should be able to tell
that a NOAA endpoint is having a bad afternoon.

So the network lives here, in a process of its own, on a timer. It writes one
JSON file per product into a cache directory -- and, for the products whose
payload is pixels rather than numbers, one binary sidecar beside it, which is
written to tmpfs instead of a flash card where there is one; see BLOB_DIR.
`load()` reads that directory and **never touches the network** -- it does not
import a HTTP library, and it returns rather than raises when a file is
missing, malformed or ancient.

  $ python3 ftdata.py --list
  $ python3 ftdata.py --once                 # one pass, then exit
  $ python3 ftdata.py --once --due --fast    # only what is quick and overdue
  $ python3 ftdata.py --loop 900             # every fifteen minutes

Every record carries `fetched_at`, and `load()` hands back the age alongside
the payload, because **age is part of the data**. A tide clock showing
yesterday's phase, or a propagation panel showing last week's K index, is
worse than one showing nothing: it is confidently wrong, and the wall gives no
hint which it is. Demos are expected to say how old their data is, and to say
so loudly once it stops being worth believing. `describe_age()` is here so
they all phrase it the same way.

# surviving a reboot, because imagery more than half an hour old is stale by

# default is /run/ftdata, which on a Pi running the fetcher under systemd is a
# line of unit file (`RuntimeDirectory=ftdata`) and nothing else: /run there is
# a ~180 MB tmpfs and a window costs about two per cent of it. What that costs
# at boot is one honest no-data card until the first fetch lands.

    say. A tide prediction is the same file all afternoon; an aircraft crosses
    the Bay in four minutes. So the timer no longer decides: it wakes often and
    asks each product whether it is due, which puts a product's cadence next to
    its TTL where the reasoning about it already is, and means adding a fast

#
# Two things make this different from the solar feed above. The first is that
# a prediction is not an observation: the file is a *forecast* spanning days
# either side of the fetch, so a record several hours old is still telling the
# truth, and the question a demo has to ask is not "how old is this?" but "does
# it still cover now?". Both are answerable -- the age comes from `load()`, the
# span is in the payload -- and tide.py checks both.
#
# The second is the station. These are per-station products, so the name
# carries the station id and `register_*` can be called again for another one;
# FT_TIDE_STATIONS and FT_CURRENT_STATIONS add stations without editing this
# file. San Francisco is only the default because that is where the wall is.
#
# Times are stored as epoch seconds, always. The API can hand back local
# station time, but that is a naive wall-clock string with no offset attached
# and it steps backwards an hour every autumn, so everything here is fetched in
# GMT and converted once. Turning an epoch back into something a human reads is
# the demo's business, and it does it in the *display's* local time -- which is
# the right answer for a wall in the same city as the station, and an honest

#
# Every product above this line is a *prediction* served as JSON. This one is a
# measurement served as fixed-width text by a machine that has been publishing
# the same format since before JSON, and both of those differences matter.
#
# The file is newest row first, which is the good luck this section is built
# on: the last day of a buoy's life is the first sixteen kilobytes of a file
# that runs to six hundred, so a ranged GET takes the part we want and leaves
# the rest on the server. NDBC serve these off CloudFront and honour
# `Range:` with a 206; a server that ignored it would answer 200 with the whole
# file and the parse below would still be right, just dearer. That is the only
# reason this is safe to do at a ten-minute cadence over shop wifi.
#
# `MM` means missing and it is *common*: a buoy with a dead wave sensor keeps
# reporting wind and water temperature for months, and the sample this was
# written against had WVHT on one row, WTMP on the next and neither on the one
# after. So nothing here assumes a row is complete. Each headline value is
# taken from the newest row that actually has it, and it carries the time of
# *that* row, because "1.9 m" and "1.9 m, six hours ago" are different claims
# and only one of them is worth animating.
#
# Two files, because they answer different questions. `.txt` is the ten-minute
# standard meteorological record -- one significant wave height, one dominant
# period, one mean direction, which is the sea summarised as though it were a
# single wave. `.spec` is the directional spectral summary, and it splits that
# into the swell and the windsea with a height, a period and a direction each.
# That split is the single most useful thing the data says: 1.9 m at 9 s out of
# the northwest with a 0.4 m windsea on top is a clean groundswell, and the
# same 1.9 m as 1.3 m of swell under 1.4 m of 4-second slop is a completely
# different afternoon in a boat. Both files are parsed the same way, off their
# own header line rather than off a hardcoded column order, so a column added

# GOES GeoColor imagery, from NESDIS STAR. goes.py plays these as a time lapse.
#
# This is the first product whose payload is not numbers, and it changes what
# the cache has to do. The other records here are a few kilobytes of JSON and
# the fetcher rewrites them wholesale every pass. A frame series cannot work
# that way: the source is a 240 kB JPEG every five minutes, a window of them is
# megabytes, and re-fetching the window each pass would put 70 MB an hour
# through the shop wifi to change three frames.
#
# So two things are different. The fetch is **incremental** -- the record lists
# the frame timestamps it already holds, and a pass downloads only the slots
# that are new and drops the ones that have aged out. And the pixels are
# **cooked before they are stored**: each JPEG is decoded, cropped and resized
# to the panel's exact geometry and only the 61 kB result is kept, so a window
# costs a twentieth of what the JPEGs would and, more to the point, the demo
# never decodes anything. Pillow lives on this side of the wall, in the fetcher
# process, next to the sockets. `goes.py` imports numpy and nothing else.
#
# The frames go in a sidecar (see store_blob) as one (N, H, W, 3) uint8 array;
# the JSON record carries the timestamps, the crop, the geometry and the name
# of the sidecar.
#
# The third difference is where that sidecar lands. 3.5 MB rewritten every pass
# is 336 MB a day at the wall's timer, and on a Pi that is SD card wear for
# pixels whose own TTL calls them stale in half an hour, so the sidecar goes to
# tmpfs and only the record goes to the card. See BLOB_DIR at the top of this
# file; nothing in this section has to know about it, because a record names a
# basename and never a directory.

# Everything above fetches a *point*: one gauge, one satellite, one index.
# This one has to fetch a **field**, because the thing worth looking at here
# is a gradient -- the Pacific marine layer accelerating through the Golden
# Gate and losing half its speed by the time it is over Oakland. One station
# cannot say that. Happily Open-Meteo takes comma-separated coordinate lists
# and answers with a JSON *list* of location objects, so a grid is one request
# rather than seventy-seven, which is the difference between a polite client
# and an abusive one.
#
# It is free and keyless, so the arithmetic of not abusing it is worth writing
# down. Open-Meteo counts a multi-location request as one call per location:
# 7x11 points, four times an hour, is 7 392 location-calls a day against a
# 10 000/day fair-use budget and 308/hour against a 5 000/hour one. That is
# the whole reason the grid is 77 points and not 200.
#
# Resolution is chosen to match the model rather than to look impressive.
# Requesting 37.81,-122.48 comes back stamped 37.8268,-122.5061 -- the API
# snaps to the model cell and *tells you where it landed* -- and the distinct
# cells in a request like this one sit about 3 km apart, which is NOAA's HRRR
# CONUS grid. Asking for points closer together than that just returns the
# same cell twice, so the payload stores the snapped coordinates, deduplicated:
# the honest statement of where these numbers actually live.
#
# Direction is stored exactly as the API gives it -- **the compass bearing the
# wind is coming FROM**, which is the meteorological convention and the
# opposite of the direction anything drawn on a map should move. Converting it
# is the demo's job and it is the one bug in this whole demo that would look
# entirely plausible on the wall.

# Hyper-local weather for the wall's own address. wx.py draws these.
#
# Three products, from three services, because no single keyless service knows
# what a panel at one street address needs to say. That is not a shortcoming
# to be papered over -- it is the fact the demo is built around, and it is why
# each product records *what kind of number it is* as well as its value:
#
#   wx-obs-<station>   a real observation, from a real instrument, 2.8 km away
#   wx-model-<site>    a numerical forecast evaluated at the exact address
#   wx-air-<site>      a chemistry model's grid cell, likewise
#
# The station is the only measurement anywhere near the building. Unioning the
# station lists of a 7x7 block of NWS gridpoints around the address turns up 52
# stations and exactly one inside San Francisco: SFOC1, "San Francisco
# Downtown", 2.8 km away. The next nearest is Oakland Museum at 12.3 km, on the
# far side of the Bay and in a different climate; KSFO is 16 km south and in
# another one again. Every dedicated PWS network -- Weather Underground,
# PurpleAir, Synoptic, AirNow -- now answers 401 or 403 without a key.
#
# **Assume no field is present.** SFOC1 reports temperature, dewpoint and
# humidity and reports `null` for wind, pressure, gust and visibility, with a
# `Z` quality flag: the fields exist in the JSON and carry nothing. Other
# stations drop other fields, and the same station drops different ones on
# different hours. So every value goes through _nws_value(), which returns None
# unless there is a number *and* the unit code is the one being converted from.
# A missing field must reach the panel as absent, never as zero.
#
# **met.no's terms are honoured here, not in the demo.** They ask for an
# identifying User-Agent with a contact address, and for the Expires header to
# be respected rather than polled through. So: FT_CONTACT (or the default
# below) goes into the UA; the response's Expires and Last-Modified are kept in
# the payload; and a fetch before Expires makes **no request at all**, while a
# fetch after it is conditional on If-Modified-Since and takes the 304 when
# offered. A --loop 900 fetcher therefore touches api.met.no about twice an
# hour, which is roughly how often the model actually changes.
#
# One consequence needs saying: when a fetch is skipped or 304s, the record is
# rewritten with a new `fetched_at` and unchanged contents, so the *fetch* age
# understates the *data* age. Every payload here therefore carries `t`, the
# epoch the numbers describe, and wx.py ages them by that instead. Age is part
# of the data, and the part that matters is the data's, not the socket's.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Wikipedia edit firehose. wiki.py draws this.
#
# Wikimedia publishes every change to every one of its nine hundred-odd wikis
# on one keyless public SSE stream, worldwide, in real time. It is the only
# source in this file that is a stream of *events* rather than a snapshot of a
# state, and that difference is the whole product: a snapshot can be fetched,
# but a firehose can only be sampled. So this fetcher opens the socket, listens
# for forty seconds, aggregates what went past, and hangs up. It is a periodic
# process like everything else here, not a daemon -- ftsched builds segments on
# a worker thread and a fetcher holding a socket open forever would be a second
# long-lived thing on the Pi for no benefit, since the panel replays a window
# rather than tracking a live cursor.
#
# **What forty seconds of it looks like**, measured rather than assumed:
# roughly 1500 messages, 36 a second, from about 40 distinct wikis, 61% of them
# flagged as bot edits. Slightly over half are `categorize` -- MediaWiki
# emitting one message per category as a page's categories change, which is
# machine bookkeeping about an edit that already has its own message -- so those
# are dropped, along with `log` (account creation, blocks, deletions: the
# identity-adjacent half of the stream and nothing this panel wants). What is
# kept is `edit` and `new`: an actual revision of an actual page. That is about
# 15 a second, and it is the number the panel puts on the wall.
#
# The traffic is the real cost. Forty seconds is about 1.7 MB off the wire,
# because every message carries the full rendered HTML of the edit summary
# whether you want it or not and there is no server-side filter to ask for
# less. At a fifteen-minute interval that is ~7 MB an hour on shop wifi, which
# is the largest number in this file and is why the interval is not shorter.
# The record it becomes is about 12 kB.
#
# **PRIVACY -- what is thrown away, in this function, before anything is
# stored.** Every message carries `user`, which is a username for a registered
# editor and a bare IP address for an anonymous one. It is never read into any
# structure here: there is no field for it in the payload, no hash of it, no
# count keyed on it. Nor is there any handle that could be turned back into it:
#
#   * `user`                 -- dropped outright. Identity, and for anonymous
#                               editors a home or workplace IP address.
#   * `comment`/`parsedcomment` -- dropped. Edit summaries are free text written
#                               by a person and routinely name people.
#   * `revision.old/new`, `id`, `meta.id`, `notify_url` -- dropped. A revision
#                               id is a one-call lookup back to its author, so
#                               keeping one would be keeping `user` in a costume.
#   * titles outside namespace 0 -- dropped. `User:Someone/sandbox` and its Talk
#                               page are a person's name in the title field, and
#                               main-space article titles are the only ones this
#                               panel wanted anyway.
#
# What is kept is the public shape of the encyclopedia and nothing about who
# wrote it: article titles, the wiki's own database name, the byte length before
# and after as a single delta, the bot flag, whether the page was new, and the
# millisecond the edit happened. None of it is reversible to a person by any
# means this record provides.
#
# **The titles need a Latin alphabet and most of the stream does not have one.**
# The demo draws in a 3x5 bitmap font -- A-Z, digits and a handful of
# punctuation -- and about 44% of main-space titles in any given window are
# Cyrillic, CJK, Devanagari, Arabic or Hebrew. A panel of tofu boxes is a
# failure, so the split is: **colour carries every project including the ones
# whose script cannot be drawn, and type carries only the ones that can.** The
# counts, the rate, the bot share and the coloured strokes are the whole
# firehose; the ticker is the subset this font can spell, and the panel says so.
# Accented Latin is folded rather than rejected (NFD, drop the combining marks,
# plus a short table for the letters that do not decompose -- ss, ae, o, th),
# which is what keeps es, fr, de, pt, pl and no in the ticker instead of only
# en. `n_titles_seen` records how many main-space titles went past so the demo
# could say what fraction survived if it ever wanted to.
#
# **The events are stored columnar and in relative time.** Three parallel lists
# -- millisecond offset from the window start, byte delta, project index -- plus
# a flags int, rather than a dict per edit; at 600 events that is worth about
# half the bytes. Relative rather than absolute time is deliberate on both
# counts: it is four digits instead of thirteen, and it is what lets the demo
# replay the window at its true internal pacing without also publishing the
# exact wall-clock second any particular article was edited.

#   api.airplanes.live/v2/point/...  works; 65 aircraft, 250 ms.
#
# The last one is what is used, and adsb.fi is the drop-in second source if it
# ever stops -- the response shapes differ only in that adsb.fi calls the list
# `aircraft` and airplanes.live calls it `ac`. Neither wants a key. Both ask for
# civility rather than credentials: airplanes.live documents roughly one request
# a second, and this asks once a minute.
#
# **Ground traffic is dropped, and counted.** Half of what comes back is parked
# or taxiing -- 36 of 70 on a Sunday morning -- reported as the *string*
# "ground" in `alt_baro` rather than a number. None of it can be dead-reckoned,
# because a pushback tug does not hold a groundspeed and a track, and a heap of
# static dots on the SFO apron is the brightest thing on the panel for the worst
# possible reason. So the record keeps the airborne ones and stores the ground
# count as a number, which is the honest version of throwing them away: the
# panel can say "34 airborne, 36 on the ground" and mean it.
#
# **The payload is columnar**, one list per field rather than one dict per
# aircraft, and that is worth about 40% of the bytes at this size -- 120
# aircraft do not need the string "alt" repeated 120 times. It also happens to
# be exactly what the demo wants, since every one of these columns becomes a
# numpy array in build() and nothing has to be transposed on a 600 MHz Pi.
#
# **Every aircraft carries its own position age.** `seen_pos` is how long ago
# that aircraft's position was last heard, and it is not the same as the age of
# the fetch: a jet over the Gate updates twice a second and something in the
# hills behind Livermore may not have been heard for half a minute. The demo
# dead-reckons from `t - pa` per aircraft rather than from one timestamp for the
# whole record, which costs one float a plane and is the difference between a
# picture that is a minute old and one that is a minute old *and knows it*.
#
# One minute is the interval and five is the TTL, and the gap between them is
# deliberate: at 500 knots a minute of extrapolation is 8 nm, which the dead
# reckoning covers, and five minutes is 40 nm, which nothing covers. Past the
# TTL the demo stops drawing aircraft rather than drawing fiction. The record is
# `volatile` because it is rewritten 1440 times a day and is worthless two
# minutes later; none of that belongs on the flash card the Pi boots from.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every BART train, as a path through time. stringline.py draws these.
#
# **Why BART.** It publishes GTFS-Realtime with no API key, no signup and no
# terms beyond politeness -- https://api.bart.gov/gtfsrt/tripupdate.aspx answers
# 200 with about 39 KB of protobuf to anybody who asks. The obvious alternative
# for a wall in the Mission is Muni, and 511.org's GTFS-RT returns 401 without a
# free-but-registered key, which was verified before this was written. So BART.
#
# **The protobuf is decoded by hand, in about sixty lines.** The proper answer
# is `gtfs-realtime-bindings`, which pulls in `protobuf`, which is a C extension
# and a wheel and a version skew on a Raspberry Pi that already has enough of
# those. What is actually needed here is five field numbers deep in a message
# whose wire format is self-describing: every field is a tag varint carrying a
# number and a type, and the four types that appear are varint, length-delimited
# and two fixed widths that can be skipped. Nothing is validated against a
# schema, which is the honest trade -- a field that changes meaning would be
# read as the old meaning -- and against that, the reader cannot be broken by a
# field being *added*, which is the thing that actually happens to these feeds.
#
# **A TripUpdate is only the future.** The feed carries, per running train, the
# stops it has not reached yet; a stop drops out behind the train as it passes.
# That is exactly half a stringline. So the fetcher keeps the other half: each
# pass merges the new predictions into what it already had for that trip, and a
# stop that has fallen out of the feed keeps the last time it was given. Since
# the fetch runs every minute, that last time was published within sixty seconds
# of the train actually being there, which makes it an observation in every
# sense that matters to a panel. The record therefore *accumulates* -- it is the
# only product here that is a function of its own previous value -- and the
# ninety minutes it holds is what the past half of the diagram is drawn from.
#
# **Trips have to be matched to a line, and the feed does not say.** BART's
# TripDescriptor carries a trip_id and nothing else: no route_id, no direction,
# no headsign. Two things recover it, in order:
#
#   1. a trip_id -> line table baked into `stringline-lines.npz` from the static
#      schedule. Trip ids are regenerated every time BART publishes a new
#      schedule, so this table goes stale a few times a year -- and is therefore
#      only ever a *hint*, accepted when the live stop list is consistent with
#      it and ignored otherwise.
#   2. failing that, the set of stations the trip calls at. A trip whose stops
#      all lie on exactly one line is on that line. Checked against the whole
#      static schedule, this is right for 2384 trips, wrong for none, and
#      undecidable for 346 -- the SFO-Millbrae and Warm Springs-Berryessa
#      shuttles, which really are on two lines at once.
#
# A trip that neither method resolves is counted and dropped, never guessed at.
# Guessing would put a Red train on the Yellow diagram, which on a stringline is
# not a small error: it invents a headway that does not exist.
#
# One minute is the interval and five the TTL, matching the ADS-B reasoning: a
# minute of drift is a train a kilometre out of place, which the diagram absorbs
# because it is drawn at two kilometres a row, and five minutes is the point at
# which the panel should say so rather than keep drawing. `volatile` because it
# is rewritten 1440 times a day and is worthless the next morning.

# registration, no terms beyond ordinary politeness. The alternative is
# EIA-930, which is the same picture an hour later and **needs an API key**,
# and OASIS, which needs a client certificate and speaks zipped XML. So this
# is the source, and it is fetched at a tenth of the rate it changes.
#
# **The paths have moved and will move again.** Every script older than about
# a year fetches `/outlook/SP/fuelsource.csv`; that 404s now. What answers
# today is `/outlook/current/<name>.csv`, with `/outlook/history/<YYYYMMDD>/`
# alongside it for finished days. Both were checked by hand before this was
# written, and CAISO_BASE is one string so the next move is one line.
#
# Three files rather than one because they are three different measurements
# and only the first is a mix:
#
#   fuelsource.csv  thirteen fuels in MW, 5-minute, midnight to now
#   demand.csv      day-ahead and hour-ahead forecasts for the *whole* day,
#                   plus actual demand up to now and nulls after it
#   co2.csv         emissions by source in metric tons an hour, to now
#
# The forecast columns are why demand.csv is worth a request of its own: they
# are the only thing in any of this that knows what the evening looks like, so
# the panel has something honest to draw to the right of the now-line instead
# of dead space.
#
# **The Time column is CAISO's own local wall clock**, "HH:MM" with no date and
# no offset, which is the Pacific zone whatever the machine fetching it thinks
# it is in. So the timestamps are resolved here, once, against
# America/Los_Angeles explicitly rather than against `localtime` -- a fetcher
# run from a laptop in another zone would otherwise write a record whose
# midnight is somebody else's midnight, and the panel would draw the whole day
# shifted with nothing to say it had. Epoch seconds from there on, like the
# tides. The two DST days are handled by resolving each row separately instead
# of assuming 288 rows times 300 seconds spans a day: in March one of those
# days is 276 rows long and in November one is 300, and a uniform grid laid
# over either puts the evening peak an hour out.
#
# Everything is stored as published, ungrouped: thirteen fuels, not five bands.
# How to group them so that sixty-four rows of LED can be read from across a
# room is a *drawing* decision and it belongs in the demo, where it can be
# argued with, rather than baked irreversibly into the cache.

# Which way San Francisco's shared bikes are moving. bikes.py draws this.
#
# **GBFS publishes no trips, and this product does not pretend otherwise.** Bay
# Wheels speaks GBFS -- the open standard every bikeshare system speaks -- and
# every feed in it is a *snapshot*: how many bikes are in each dock at this
# instant, and where the undocked ebikes are lying. There is no origin in it, no
# destination, no journey and no rider. Anything anybody says about bikes moving
# from A to B is inferred from how the counts changed between two snapshots, and
# the whole design of this record is about making that inference small, checkable
# and impossible to mistake for observation.
#
# So the fetcher takes a snapshot every ten minutes, differences it against the
# one before, and stores two derived quantities per interval and nothing else:
#
#   mov    the sum of |change| over every station, matched by station. One bike
#          ridden from one dock to another contributes 2 to it -- minus one at
#          the dock it left, plus one at the dock it reached -- so `mov / 2` is a
#          count of docked bikes that changed place. It is a **floor** and not a
#          trip count: two riders swapping a dock inside one ten-minute window
#          cancel and are invisible, a bike that leaves a dock and is left loose
#          at the kerb is a departure with no matching arrival, and an operator's
#          van moving fifteen bikes at once looks exactly like fifteen riders.
#
#   flow   the *net* change in docked bikes for each of forty bands of distance
#          from the Ferry Building. This is the only thing here that is a field:
#          its running sum along the axis is the net number of bikes that had to
#          cross each distance, which is a conserved quantity and is what a swarm
#          can honestly be drawn from. Churn inside a band cancels out of it by
#          construction, which is the point -- what survives is structure.
#
# **The axis is distance from downtown, and that is a choice with a reason.**
# San Francisco's 383 docks are a blob 11.9 km by 12.4 km, so a map of them on a
# panel five times wider than it is tall would spend three hundred columns saying
# that the city is square. Distance from the Ferry Building is instead the one
# spatial variable the data actually varies along: the commute is in and out of
# it, and it happens to run downhill, which is why the ground elevation is kept
# alongside. `bikes.py` draws the pair as a cross-section -- how far out, and how
# high up -- and the flow as a swarm over it.
#
# **It attaches an altitude to every station.** GBFS carries lat/lon and no
# elevation. The heights come from a committed bake, `demos/bikes-terrain.npz`,
# so nothing on the wall ever asks a terrain service anything -- see
# BIKES_TERRAIN below for its provenance and for what happens to a station the
# bake has never heard of.
#
# **It reduces 790 kB to about twenty.** Three feeds, 634 stations and 600-odd
# loose bikes go in. What comes out is five short arrays over the stations inside
# the city sorted by distance, a rolling twelve hours of forty-number flow
# vectors, and a couple of dozen scalars. The arrays stay per-station rather than
# being binned into panel columns here, for the same reason caiso-mix stores
# thirteen fuels and not five bands: how to bin them is a drawing decision and it
# belongs where it can be argued with. The *flow* is binned here, because a
# rolling day of 383 numbers per interval would not be small and forty is enough
# resolution for a field whose shortest real feature is a neighbourhood.
#
# **It remembers, and it has to.** A snapshot feed cannot answer "what happened
# in the last hour" at all, so each pass appends one entry to a rolling series
# kept in the record. Ten-minute buckets keyed on absolute epoch rather than a
# growing list: a bucket fetched twice is overwritten, a bucket that is missed is
# simply absent, the series is trimmed to twelve hours and 80 entries on every
# write, and a record restored from before a reboot picks up where it left off.
# That is why this product is deliberately *not* volatile -- the accumulated half
# day is the only thing here that cannot be re-fetched. On a cold cache there is
# no flow at all until the second pass lands, which is a state bikes.py draws in
# words rather than hiding.
#
# **Cost.** Three requests, about 790 kB, every ten minutes: 1.3 kB/s averaged,
# which is half what quake-week costs. station_information is nearly static and
# could be fetched far more rarely, but re-fetching it is what makes a
# newly-installed station appear correctly rather than being quietly dropped, and
# 348 kB per ten minutes is not worth a staleness bug.

# Observed journeys, for the free-floating ebikes only, and the privacy design
# that goes with them.
#
# **What was measured.** free_bike_status carries two identifiers per undocked
# ebike: `bike_id`, an opaque 32-hex token, and `name`, the number printed on
# the physical bike ("190-591"). GBFS rotates `bike_id` between rentals
# specifically so that trips cannot be reconstructed, and it does: across two
# snapshots 36 minutes apart, 0 of 634 tokens survived, and across two four
# minutes apart 590 of 624 survived but *not one of the survivors had moved* --
# the token is stable exactly while the bike sits still. `name` is not rotated:
# 585 of 620 survived 36 minutes, with a median displacement of 4.5 m and a
# 90th percentile of 11 m, which is GPS jitter, and nine bikes that had plainly
# been ridden somewhere.
#
# So for this subset -- and only this subset -- a journey is *observable*: the
# same physical bike seen at two places at two times. That is a materially
# better thing to draw than an inference, and it is what the panel now leads
# with. What it is not is the whole system: about 620 free-floating ebikes
# against 383 docks and some 2 700 docked bikes, and a bike that docks simply
# vanishes from this feed. The panel says which fleet it is drawing.
#
# **The privacy design, which is deliberate and not boilerplate.** The spec
# rotates `bike_id` to stop exactly what `name` makes possible again, and this
# record is going to live on a wall in a public makerspace. So:
#
#   * The printed number is hashed the moment it is read and the raw string
#     never reaches a variable that is stored. Nothing anywhere in the payload,
#     and nothing on the panel, is a bike number.
#   * The tokens live in `loose_base` only, which holds *one* snapshot and is
#     overwritten on every pass. No identifier of any kind enters `hist`. So
#     the record cannot link a bike across more than a single ten-minute
#     interval, however long the fetcher has been running -- there is no
#     accumulating trip history in it to obtain.
#   * What survives into the history is a pair of positions on the panel's own
#     distance axis, rounded to 100 m, with no way back to which bike made it.
#
# The hash is not itself the control and is not claimed as one: six-digit bike
# numbers are a small enough space to enumerate, so an attacker holding a
# record could recover the current snapshot's numbers -- which the public feed
# already gives them. The control is that history carries no identifier at all.
#

# Below it a bike has not moved; above it, it has been somewhere.

# Not a flag on product(), for the same reason goes-psw does it this way: the

# which is that it reads its own previous record both to extend the rolling
# series and to difference this snapshot against the last one, and doing that
# against ftdata's default cache while the fetcher was pointed at another one
# would silently graft two machines' histories together.
PRODUCTS[BIKES_PRODUCT]["blob"] = True

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The bike docks within a walk of the front door. docks.py draws this.
#
# **A different question from `baywheels`, off the same three feeds.** That
# product is about the city: a flow field over twelve kilometres, differenced
# between snapshots, replayed over half a day. This one is about the next sixty
# seconds for somebody standing in the workshop -- is there a bike within a few
# minutes' walk, is it an ebike, and coming the other way, is there a free dock
# to put one in. Nothing here is differenced against anything and nothing here
# accumulates: it is a snapshot of about forty docks, and when it is stale it is
# simply wrong rather than incomplete, which is why the TTL is short and the
# panel prints the age.
#
# It is a separate product rather than more fields on `baywheels` because the
# two want opposite things from the fetcher. `baywheels` must not be sampled
# faster than its ten-minute history bucket and must never be volatile, because
# the accumulated half day is the only thing in it that cannot be re-fetched.
# This one wants two minutes and is worth nothing after a reboot.
#
# **The docked ebike count is `num_ebikes_available`, and this is the one field
# it is easy to get wrong.** GBFS 2.x also defines
# `num_bikes_available_types`, which is the obvious place to look and which
# Lyft's SF feed does not publish at all -- the key is absent from every one of
# the 634 stations, so code that reads it gets zero everywhere and quietly
# reports that San Francisco has no docked ebikes. It has plenty: 36 of the 100
# docked bikes within a kilometre of the wall on the evening this was written.
# `num_ebikes_available` is a *subset* of `num_bikes_available`, so the classic
# count is the difference and the two add up to the total, which is how the
# panel columns it.
#
# **The crop is a circle and not a bounding box.** `baywheels` takes a lat/lon
# box because it wants a city; this wants "how far do I have to walk", so the
# radius is a real distance from one point and the payload is sorted by it.
# 1.5 km stored against the panel's default 1.0 km of drawing, so `--radius` can
# be turned up on the wall without the fetcher having to agree.
#
# **Cost, and the one piece of caching in this file.** Three feeds are 795 kB:
# station_information 348, station_status 243, free_bike_status 204. Taking all
# three every two minutes would be 6.6 kB/s sustained, which is five times what
# `baywheels` costs and more than this panel is worth. But station_information
# is *near-static* -- names, coordinates and dock capacities, changing when a
# station is installed or moved -- so the trimmed version of it (the forty-odd
# stations inside the radius, about a kilobyte) is kept in the record and reused
# for an hour. Steady state is then status plus free bikes, 447 kB every two
# minutes, 3.7 kB/s, with one 348 kB request an hour on top. What that costs is
# that a station installed inside the radius can take up to an hour to appear,
# which for a thing that happens a few times a year is the right trade. Set
# DOCKS_INFO_TTL to 0 to turn the cache off.

# The Sun's corona in the 193 A channel of SDO/AIA, as a day-long time lapse.
# sun.py draws this.
#
# SDO has been staring at the Sun from geosynchronous orbit since 2010, and
# GSFC publishes every AIA frame as a browse JPEG within a few minutes of it
# coming off the telescope. 193 angstroms is Fe XII/XXIV at about 1.2 million
# kelvin: the channel where the corona is legible rather than the photosphere,
# so what the picture shows is the *magnetic* Sun -- active regions as bright
# knots, coronal loops arcing off them, and coronal holes as the black gaps
# that open-field solar wind escapes through. It is the channel people mean
# when they say "a picture of the Sun".
#
# **Two endpoints, and the expensive one is only used to repair.** Frames live
# at `/assets/img/browse/YYYY/MM/DD/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_512_0193.jpg`, and the
# directory is a plain Apache index -- which is the problem: it lists ten
# wavelengths plus magnetograms for a whole day, so it is **1.2 MB of HTML,
# served uncompressed** (no gzip on Accept-Encoding, and Range requests are
# ignored -- asking for the last 120 kB returns all 1.2 MB with a 200). Pulling
# that every pass would cost 57 MB a day to learn the name of one new file,
# many times what the imagery itself costs.
#
# The filenames cannot be predicted either, which is what makes the listing
# necessary at all. GOES above gets away with naming tomorrow's files because
# its scans are exactly on a five-minute grid; AIA's are not. Over one sampled
# day the cadence is nominally ten minutes but the minute wanders (00:07,
# 00:17, 00:27, 00:37, 00:48, 00:57 ...) and the seconds land only on a
# twelve-second grid, {05, 17, 29, 41, 53}. There are holes, too -- one
# nineteen-minute gap in 105 frames, an eclipse season or a calibration slot.
# So a name has to be read, never computed.
#
# What saves it is that `/assets/img/latest/latest_512_0193.jpg` is the newest
# frame at a **fixed** URL, 44 kB, with a `Last-Modified` that dates the
# publication rather than the fetch. So the ring is topped up from `latest` and
# nothing else in the ordinary case -- one 44 kB request per slot, no listing at
# all -- and the listing is fetched only when the ring has a hole older than an
# hour, which means a cold start or a fetcher that has been down. Steady state
# is about 2 MB a day; a cold start pays one or two listings once.
#
# `Last-Modified` is not the observation time and this stores the difference.
# A frame captured at 17:38:05 UT appeared with `Last-Modified` 17:43:06 GMT,
# so publication trails the shutter by very close to five minutes, and
# SDO_PUBLISH_LAG backs that out to keep the two paths' timestamps comparable.
# It is an estimate on the frames sampled here, not a guarantee; the residual
# error is a few minutes on a twenty-four hour axis, which is under a pixel.
#
# **One channel is stored, not three, and that is lossless here.** The browse
# JPEG is already false colour: AIA 193 is drawn through a fixed one
# dimensional bronze colormap, so G and B are functions of R and not
# independent information. Binning a frame confirms it -- at a given intensity
# the spread in the other two channels is one to five levels, which is JPEG
# ringing rather than colour. So the fetcher keeps a single intensity plane and
# sun.py maps it back through its own copy of that ramp, which thirds the
# sidecar and, more usefully, puts the contrast curve under the demo's control
# instead of NASA's. The index is (R+G+B)/3 rather than R alone on purpose: R
# saturates at 255 before the other two do, and the pixels where it saturates
# are exactly the flare cores worth keeping apart from merely bright.
#
# The disk does not fill the frame and its radius is not assumed. On the 512 px
# browse image the Sun is centred on (255.5, 255.5) with a photospheric radius
# of about 203 px -- measured from the radial profile, which peaks sharply at
# r=200 where the limb brightens and has fallen to a tenth by r=250. The crop
# is 216 px of half-width, so the disk covers 94 per cent of the tile and a
# little corona survives around it. That crop also throws away the caption GSFC
# burns into the bottom of every browse frame (`SDO/AIA 193 2026-08-11
# 17:38:05 UT`, rows 492-504), which would otherwise arrive as unreadable
# smeared type along the bottom of the panel.

# The ground under the building. quake.py draws this.
#
# **One feed, two scales, and a third request that is not a feed.** USGS
# publishes a fixed set of summary GeoJSON files, regenerated every minute and
# served off a CDN, and `all_week.geojson` alone answers both halves of what the
# panel wants: everything the ANSS network located anywhere on Earth in the last
# seven days, which contains both every M0.4 under Berkeley and every M4.5+ from
# Tonga. Taking one file rather than composing `all_day` with `2.5_week` and
# `4.5_week` avoids the whole class of bug where two feeds disagree about the
# same event -- USGS revises magnitudes for hours after an origin, and two files
# fetched a second apart can hold two versions of one earthquake. It is 1.4 MB,
# which at a ten-minute cadence is 2.4 kB/s averaged, and the record we keep
# from it is about forty times smaller.
#
# What is stored is trimmed to what quake.py draws:
#
#   local    every event within 300 km of the wall, no magnitude floor at all,
#            with distance and bearing precomputed here so the demo never does
#            trigonometry per frame
#   world    the M4.5+ of the week as (time, magnitude) pairs only -- that is a
#            sparkline and nothing else -- plus the single largest in full
#   baseline the last M4.0+ within 100 km, whenever it was
#
# **The baseline is the one thing the feeds cannot answer**, and the panel's
# headline number depends on it. A local M4 happens a few times a year, so on
# almost every day of the year the answer lies outside every summary window that
# exists -- `significant_month` is global and a Bay Area M4.2 does not qualify.
# So that one number comes from the FDSN event service instead, which is the
# same catalogue and equally keyless: one radius query, `limit=1`, ordered by
# time, about 1 kB and under a second. It is fetched inside its own try/except
# because a failure there must not cost us the week's events too; when it fails
# the payload carries `baseline: null` and quake.py prints `--` rather than a
# number it does not have.
#
# **Quarry blasts are dropped.** The feed's `type` field distinguishes
# `earthquake` from `quarry blast`, `explosion` and `ice quake`, and the East Bay
# quarries put several a week into a 300 km radius. A demo about the ground
# moving on its own should not count somebody's morning shot, so non-earthquakes
# are filtered and the count of what was dropped is kept, because a filter you
# cannot see is a filter you cannot check.

# California's water year: what is in the reservoirs and what is still on the
# mountain. wateryear.py draws this.
#
# The state's whole hydrology is one annual cycle. Everything it will get falls
# between October and April, most of it lands as snow on the Sierra, and the
# snow is a second reservoir -- bigger than any of the concrete ones -- that
# releases itself over the following three months. So the interesting quantity
# is never today's number: it is *the shape of the year so far*, which is why
# this record is a whole water year of daily samples rather than a snapshot.
#
# **CDEC is the source and it is keyless.** The California Data Exchange Center
# has served the same JSON servlet for a decade:
#
#   /dynamicapp/req/JSONDataServlet?Stations=SHA,ORO&SensorNums=15
#                                  &dur_code=D&Start=2025-10-01&End=2026-08-11
#
# Stations are comma-separated and it will happily take twenty of them in one
# request, which is the only reason the snow index below is affordable. Sensor
# 15 is reservoir storage in acre-feet; sensor 82 is the revised daily snow
# water equivalent at a snow pillow, in inches. `dur_code=D` is the daily
# series. Sixteen years of one station is a megabyte and comes back in half a
# second, which is what makes the normals bake below possible at all.
#
# Three things about the responses that cost time to find out:
#
#   * **Missing is `-9999`, not null.** Every row that exists has a `value`,
#     and the sentinel for "the gauge did not report" is -9999. There is also
#     the string "m" in some sensors' output. Both become None here, and so
#     does any storage that reads as zero -- Shasta does not empty.
#   * **The date field is not ISO.** It is `"2026-8-11 00:00"`: no zero
#     padding on the month or the day. Anything that slices fixed columns out
#     of it works for ten days of the month and then quietly stops.
#   * **Rows for days a station never reported are simply absent**, so the
#     response length is not the number of days asked for and the series has to
#     be built by date and not by position.
#
# CDEC is a state service on a state budget and it times out. Everything here
# is written so that one dead station costs one vessel on the panel and one
# dead region costs one third of the snow band; nothing is fatal but a total
# failure of the reservoir request, and even that leaves yesterday's record in
# place because `fetch()` does not overwrite on an exception.
#
# **Capacities are a constant table, not a lookup.** Percent of capacity needs
# each reservoir's gross pool, and CDEC does publish it -- in the `RES` report,
# which is 116 kB of HTML wrapped around the number. The capacities themselves
# are physical facts about dams that were finished between 1945 and 1979 and
# have not changed in this century, so they are written down here with the
# report they came from cited, and the panel does not spend a request and an
# HTML parser on re-learning that Shasta is still 4,552,000 acre-feet.
#
# **Percent of average is derived here, not fetched, and it is the number the
# panel is for.** The same `RES` report carries CDEC's own "% of historical
# average", but against an unstated period of record, and it exists only for
# today -- there is no way to ask it what average storage on the 3rd of
# February looks like, which is what a panel that animates the year needs. So
# the normals are baked once, from complete past water years pulled through
# this same servlet, into demos/wateryear-normals.npz:
#
#   $ python3 -c "import ftdata; ftdata.wateryear_bake_normals()"
#
# That is a few minutes of fetching, run by hand, and the result is committed.
# Nothing in the timer path ever fetches history. The baseline period is
# written into the file so the panel can say what it is comparing against,
# which CDEC's own figure cannot.
#
# **Eight reservoirs, north to south**, which is the panel's horizontal axis:
# Trinity, Shasta, Oroville, Folsom, New Melones, Don Pedro, McClure, Pine
# Flat. Between them they are 17.9 million acre-feet of the state's roughly 42,
# and they run from the Trinity Alps to the southern Sierra in monotonic
# latitude order, so left-to-right on the panel is north-to-south on the map.
# San Luis is deliberately not among them: it is off-stream, it is filled by
# pumping rather than by a river, and its curve is a delivery schedule rather
# than a watershed.
#
# **Snow is three regional indices**, which is how the Cooperative Snow Surveys
# report it: North, Central and South Sierra. Six snow pillows each, chosen for
# a spread of basins and elevations and for having reported continuously since
# 2011 -- checked, station by station, against this servlet before the list was
# written down. The index is the mean of whichever of the six answered that
# day, which is exactly what CDEC's own `DLYSWEQ` summary does with its 32, 54
# and 25 stations; the count is stored alongside so the demo can tell a real
# zero in October from a region that went dark. `DLYSWEQ` itself is not used
# because it only serves dates inside the snow season and freezes on the last
# one -- in August it will cheerfully hand you June's numbers.

# Raw ground motion, from the seismometer ten miles from the wall.
# helicorder.py draws these as a drum recorder.
#
# quake-usgs above is the *processed* end of this pipeline: events, located,
# with a magnitude on them, after somebody's algorithm has decided they are
# events at all. This is the other end -- the ground going up and down at one
# station, which is the measurement everything else is derived from, and which
# is mostly a flat line with a microseism wobble in it. That is the point of
# drawing it: the quiet is the data too.
#
# **The station is BK.BRK, Byerly Vault on the UC Berkeley campus**, an STS-2
# broadband seismometer 17 km from the wall -- close enough that anything the
# room would feel is emphatic on this trace, and it is a real instrument that a
# person could walk to. BHZ is the 40 sps vertical channel. Berkeley's own
# network is served by NCEDC's FDSN endpoints, keyless, no signup, no quota
# published; the same query shape works for BK.BRIB and BK.BKS if this vault
# ever goes off the air.
#
# **The data is miniSEED with Steim2 compression and there is no ASCII option
# for this network**, which is the one real cost in this product. EarthScope's
# `irisws/timeseries` will hand out ASCII but it does not archive BK, only the
# global networks, and a panel captioned "ground motion near you" showing a
# station in New Mexico would be a lie told to avoid a hundred lines of code.
# So `_steim_decode()` below is that hundred lines. It is checked on every
# record against the reverse integration constant -- Steim2 stores the last
# sample of each record redundantly in the header frame precisely so that a
# decoder can prove it walked the differences correctly -- and a mismatch
# raises rather than storing a plausible wrong wiggle.
#
# **What is stored is an envelope, not a waveform.** Six hours at 40 sps is
# 864,000 samples and 1.7 MB of miniSEED; what the panel can draw is 1800
# columns one pixel wide. Each column is 12 seconds reduced to its minimum and
# its maximum, which is exactly what a helicorder pen does and is the one
# decimation that does not lie about amplitude -- a mean would flatten every
# burst, and a subsample would hit or miss one at random. 3600 numbers, about
# 22 kB of JSON: the whole six hours at the finest resolution the panel can
# actually show.
#
# **It tops up rather than refetching.** The grid is anchored to absolute
# 12-second bins, so a fetch five minutes after the last one asks NCEDC for
# five minutes (23 kB) and slides the previous columns along. A cold start, or
# a gap longer than the window, fetches the whole six hours once. That is the
# difference between 7 MB an hour off the shop wifi and 300 kB.
#
# The baseline is removed before storing: an STS-2 wanders a couple of thousand
# counts over six hours with the temperature and the tide, which at this scale
# is half a trace lane of slow drift that has nothing to do with anything. A
# two-minute box smoothing of each column's midpoint is subtracted, which is
# the modern equivalent of the pen's zero adjustment. Everything above about a
# minute of period goes with it, and nothing a local earthquake does is that
# slow.
#
# FT_HELICORDER_END pins the end of the window to a fixed time, which is how
# the screenshot of a real earthquake in the README was made and how the tests
# get a known six hours. Unset -- always, on the wall -- it means now.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Particulates and visibility over the wall's own address. air.py draws these.
#
# **Why this is not `wx-air-<site>`.** That product already exists a thousand
# lines up and it is the right shape for what wx.py wants: `current=` gives one
# instant, five species, and a number to print in a corner. air.py wants the
# opposite -- one species, forty-nine hours of it, half of them in the future --
# because the panel is about a *trend arriving*, and the difference between a
# clear September afternoon and the day a fire starts upwind is entirely in the
# slope. Bolting `hourly=` onto the wx product would have made every wx fetch
# forty times bigger for a number wx.py does not draw. So: a second record, the
# same free keyless service, one more request an hour.
#
# **The window is now-24h to now+24h, forty-nine hourly slots.** `past_days` and
# `forecast_days` are the only controls the API has and they snap to whole days,
# so the request covers five days and everything outside the window is thrown
# away here rather than stored. That is the point of the fetcher: 6 kB of JSON
# over the wire becomes about 250 numbers on the flash card.
#
# **Times are asked for in UTC, deliberately.** Open-Meteo's default is GMT but
# the documented default is not a promise, and `timezone=` also decides where
# the `past_days` day boundaries fall. UTC is asked for explicitly, epochs are
# stored, and air.py turns them into local hours for its labels the same way
# caiso.py does. `forecast_days=3` rather than 2 because with UTC days the
# window's right-hand end can otherwise fall up to an hour past the last
# forecast hour, in the hour before UTC midnight.
#
# **Two endpoints, and the second one is allowed to fail.** The air-quality API
# has the particulates; the ordinary forecast API has relative humidity and the
# model's own visibility diagnostic. Both are needed because the panel draws
# visibility, and *fog and smoke both destroy visibility while meaning opposite
# things*. karl.py already owns fog; this panel has to be able to tell it apart
# from smoke or it is lying twice a week in July. The split it uses is:
#
#     b_pm  = 3 * PM2.5 + 10        extinction from particles, Mm^-1
#     b_tot = 3912 / visibility_km  extinction the model says there is
#     b_fog = b_tot - b_pm          whatever is left, which is water
#
# -- the Koschmieder relation and the IMPROVE-style mass scattering efficiency,
# both crude and both good enough to separate brown from white. That arithmetic
# is air.py's, not this file's; what is stored is the three inputs, because
# storing a derived number is how a panel ends up unable to say why.
#
# If the humidity request fails, `rh` and `vis_km` are stored as null and the
# panel falls back to particulates alone, which loses the fog distinction and
# nothing else. If the *air-quality* request fails the product fails, because
# without PM2.5 there is no panel.
#
# **A surprise worth writing down: the two endpoints answer for different grid
# cells.** The air-quality model is CAMS at about 11 km and it answered for
# 37.80, -122.40 -- roughly Fisherman's Wharf, 4 km north of the building. The
# forecast model is finer and answered for 37.763, -122.413, half a mile away.
# Both are stored, as `grid` and `wx_grid`, because "modelled for a cell that
# contains most of the northeast quadrant of the city" is the honest description
# of this number and the panel is entitled to say so.
#
# **Aerosol optical depth rides along.** It is literally an opacity -- the
# column integral of extinction, which is nearer to what the panel draws than a
# surface concentration is -- and it costs one more series. It is not what the
# picture is driven by, because AOD is a whole-column number and a smoke plume
# aloft at 3 km darkens the sun without making the street any harder to breathe
# in; PM2.5 is the number the health advice is written against and the one
# somebody walking past is actually asking about. AOD is stored so the two can
# be compared, and because the day they disagree is interesting.
#
# TTL three hours, interval one hour. The model is revised hourly at best, and
# a curve fetched two hours ago is still very nearly the same curve; past three
# the panel says STALE. Twenty-four passes a day at two requests each is about
# as polite as a wall can be to a free service.

# Orbital elements, from CelesTrak's GP service. sats.py propagates these.
#
# This is the slowest-moving product in the file and the fastest-moving demo,
# which is the whole point of it. Everything else here fetches a *number that
# changes* -- a tide height, a K index, a wind field -- and the panel is only as
# alive as the fetcher. These are elements: they describe an orbit rather than a
# position, they are revised about once a day, and the demo turns them into a
# position by knowing what time it is. So `sats.py` moves continuously, forever,
# on a cache record that is three days old and still perfectly good.
#
# Hence ttl=3 days and interval=86400. Fetching this every quarter hour would be
# 96 requests a day at CelesTrak to receive the same file 95 times; the service
# is free, keyless and asks politely for exactly this restraint. Not volatile:
# a record worth three days is emphatically worth surviving a reboot, and one
# write a day is nothing on any flash card.
#
# **Three group queries, not fifteen object queries.** `gp.php?CATNR=25544`
# works and would fetch precisely what is wanted, but fifteen of them is fifteen
# requests for 8 kB of data that three requests already contain. GROUP=stations
# is 9 kB, GROUP=amateur 40 kB and GROUP=weather 30 kB; the union is parsed,
# fifteen objects are picked out of it by NORAD number and the other 180 are
# dropped. What is stored is 2 kB.
#
# **GROUP=noaa no longer exists.** The obvious pick for a ham-adjacent wall is
# NOAA 15/18/19, the APT birds a $20 dongle can hear -- and CelesTrak answers
# `GROUP=noaa not found` now, with those three gone from GROUP=weather too,
# because NOAA ended POES operations in 2025 and the group went with them. The
# polar weather birds here are their successors: NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 (JPSS,
# HRD not APT), MetOp-B and Meteor-M2 3, which is the one still transmitting
# LRPT that anybody in the shop could actually receive.
#
# **The payload is the seven mean elements and nothing else**, because that is
# what the propagator in sats.py consumes. BSTAR is dropped: it is the SGP4 drag
# term, sats.py does not implement SGP4, and storing a number the demo cannot
# honour would invite somebody to assume it does. MEAN_MOTION_DOT is kept and is
# used -- it is the TLE's n-dot/2 in rev/day^2, and the quadratic term it feeds
# into the mean anomaly is the one piece of drag a Kepler propagator can carry.
#
# Times are epoch seconds, as everywhere else here. The EPOCH field is an ISO
# stamp in UTC with no offset on it and microseconds that matter -- a second of
# epoch error is 7 km along track for the ISS -- so it is parsed rather than
# truncated.

# An hour of solar wind in flight between L1 and the Earth. solarwind.py draws
# it as a picture rather than a readout: the stream across the panel, the
# interplanetary field carried in it, and the magnetosphere it runs into.
#
# **Why the geospace file and not the plasma/mag pair.** The obvious endpoints
# are `/products/solar-wind/plasma-*.json` and `mag-*.json`, and every tutorial
# on the internet still names them. They 404. So does the whole
# `/products/solar-wind/` directory -- the same disappearance that made
# swpc_solarwind above fall back to the two sixty-byte summary files. What is
# still served, and is far better than either, is
# `/products/geospace/propagated-solar-wind-1-hour.json`: one 6.6 kB table,
# one row a minute for the last hour, with speed, density, temperature, the
# full field vector in GSM, |B|, and -- the part that matters here -- a
# `propagated_time_tag` saying when each sample will actually reach the bow
# shock. It is the input to SWPC's own geospace model, so it is the tidiest
# and least gap-ridden solar wind series they publish.
#
# **The window is the transit time, which is a gift.** A sample measured at L1
# reaches the Earth roughly forty-five to fifty minutes later at typical wind
# speeds, and the file holds sixty minutes. So the file is, almost exactly, the
# plasma currently in flight: its oldest row is arriving at the magnetosphere
# about now and its newest row has just been measured a million and a half
# kilometres upstream. A panel that lays the rows out left to right is
# therefore not a chart with a time axis pretending to be a picture -- it is a
# picture, of where the plasma is. That coincidence is the whole reason
# solarwind.py exists in the shape it does, and it is why the arrival stamps
# are kept in the record rather than trimmed away: the demo prints how far
# ahead the leading edge is.
#
# The rows carry nulls when an instrument drops out, and they are stored as
# nulls rather than filled here. The gap is real information -- three minutes
# of missing density during a shock arrival is exactly when it happens -- and
# the demo can draw a hole more honestly than the fetcher can invent a value.
#
# The aurora power rides along because it is 14 kB of text and the alternative
# is not. `ovation_aurora_latest.json` is the gridded oval, and it is 900 kB of
# JSON, every fetch, to be reduced to two numbers by the time it reaches a
# panel where the Earth is five pixels across. `aurora-nowcast-hemi-power.txt`
# is the same model's hemispheric integral, in gigawatts, at five-minute
# cadence, and two numbers is all this panel can draw. Ten quiet gigawatts, a
# hundred in a storm.

#
# **Why RouteViews at SFMIX and not the obvious live feed.** RIPE's RIS Live
# streams the whole default-free zone over plain HTTP as newline-delimited
# JSON, and it was the first thing tried here. It works, and it is the wrong
# tool for this panel for two reasons. Unfiltered it delivered 78 MB in 25
# seconds -- that is not going anywhere near a Pi on shop wifi -- and even
# filtered to one collector it can only ever be *sampled*: the fetcher opens
# the socket, reads for twenty seconds, and closes it, so the other hundred and
# sixty seconds of every three minutes are simply not observed. A burst that
# lasted a minute would be missed entirely, and a chart that silently omits the
# interesting parts is a worse chart than a coarser one that does not.
#
# The RouteViews archive has the opposite shape. Every collector writes a
# complete MRT dump of every update it saw in each fifteen-minute window and
# publishes it about a minute after the window closes, bzip2'd. One 1.2 MB file
# gets **the entire window**, 75,000 messages, with per-second resolution and
# nothing sampled away. It is a quarter of an hour behind, and that is a trade
# worth making: this panel is about rate and texture, not about the last
# second, and the age is on the screen anyway.

# And the collector is `route-views.sfmix` -- RouteViews' vantage point inside
# the San Francisco Metropolitan Internet Exchange, which is a couple of miles
# from the wall and is where the makerspace's own ISP hands off its traffic.
# The routes this panel draws are the ones the room's packets are actually
# steered by, which is not a claim any of the other collectors could make.
# Eight networks peer with it -- Cloudflare and Amazon among them -- so the
# feed is a genuinely local view of a global table rather than a global average
# of one.
#
# **MRT is parsed here, by hand, and that needs justifying.** The usual answer
# is libbgpstream or mrtparse, and neither is going on a Pi for this: the first
# is a C library with a build, the second pulls in a dependency tree to do
# something this file already does for PDFs. The wire format is RFC 6396 and
# RFC 4271 and the part of it a churn counter needs is small -- walk the record
# frames, find the BGP UPDATEs, count the prefixes in the withdrawn block, the
# NLRI block and the two multiprotocol attributes, and read the AS_PATH. What
# is deliberately *not* implemented is everything else: communities, MED,
# aggregators, the legacy two-byte-ASN subtypes nobody has emitted this decade.
# An attribute this does not understand is skipped by its own length field,
# which is why an unknown one cannot desynchronise the parse.
#
# **Where the cost is.** 12.5 MB of MRT and 75,000 records is 0.5 s of pure
# Python on a desktop, so call it ten on the wall, once every fifteen minutes,
# in the fetcher process and never in a demo. Both ends are capped anyway --
# see BGP_MAX_BZ2, BGP_MAX_MRT and BGP_MAX_RECORDS -- and a capped parse says
# so in the record rather than quietly reporting a low rate.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ship movements at the Port of San Francisco, from the Port's own cruise
# terminal schedule. ships.py draws them against the Golden Gate tide.
#
# **Why a schedule and not AIS.** The obvious source for "what is moving in the
# Bay" is AIS, and every AIS feed within reach of this project wants a key:
# aisstream.io, MarineTraffic and VesselFinder all register you first, and
# AISHub's price is a receiver of your own feeding the pool. The Marine
# Exchange of the San Francisco Bay Region does publish exactly the report this
# demo would want -- due to arrive, due to depart, vessels in port, updated
# around the clock -- and sells it to members; sfmx.org has the sample PDFs up
# and the live ones behind the membership. So there is no keyless live-position
# feed for this bay, and a wall in a workshop is not going to invent one.
#
# What *is* public, free and authoritative is the Port's own cruise terminal
# schedule: a PDF calendar of every cruise call at Piers 27 and 35 for the year,
# with the vessel, the berth, the line, the ETA and ETD to the minute and the
# port either side. Cruise ships are the largest vessels that come through the
# Gate on a published timetable, which makes them the ones this panel can say
# something true about.
#
# **A caveat that belongs in the record and not just in the demo.** These are
# *berth* times at Pier 27 or 35, not Golden Gate transit times. A ship
# alongside at 07:00 passed under the bridge the better part of an hour
# earlier. Nothing here converts between the two, because the conversion
# depends on the pilot, the ship and the day, and a made-up offset drawn to the
# minute would look exactly as authoritative as the published number beside it.
#
# **Scraping, defensively.** The current PDF's URL carries the revision date, so
# it changes every few weeks and cannot be hardcoded; the fetch reads the
# Port's cruise page and takes the links off it. The PDF itself is parsed here
# rather than by a library, because there is no PDF module in this project's
# dependencies and adding one to a Pi for eleven columns of a table is a poor
# trade. The parse is positional: inflate the content streams, recover the
# (x, y) of every text run, group runs into rows by y, and assign each cell to
# the nearest column of the *header row it found in the document*. That last
# part is what makes it survive a layout edit -- the columns are read from the
# page, not from a table of offsets in this file. When it does eventually break
# it raises, and `fetch()` leaves the previous record alone.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Both are standard library and neither opens anything, so they sit at module
# level with the regexes that need them rather than being imported per call --
# unlike urllib above, which is deferred to keep `load()` provably offline.

# `data_loaded_at` was 03:16. So there is a ten to thirty hour lag between a
# call to 311 and its appearance here, and a panel promising "today, live"
# would be lying by most of a day.
#
# What that buys, though, is the better story: the snapshot always contains one
# *complete* calendar day, midnight to midnight, which is exactly the shape a
# daily rhythm wants. So the fetcher asks for `max(requested_datetime)`, takes
# the calendar date off it, and fetches that whole day. The record carries the
# day and the timestamp of its last case; the demo prints both and how old they
# are. Rolling "the last 24 hours" would give the same window today and would
# quietly become a ragged partial day the moment the city went hourly, so the
# day is derived from the data rather than from the clock.
#
# **`requested_datetime` is a floating timestamp in local time.** Socrata stores
# it with no zone and the city writes Pacific wall-clock into it, so the string
# comparisons in `$where` are local-midnight to local-midnight with no
# conversion, and `time.mktime` on the parsed struct is the right way back to an
# epoch *on a machine set to Pacific time*, which the wall is. A machine in
# another zone will read the day's edges as its own midnight; that is a
# one-line fix nobody needs and would make the SoQL wrong on the wall.
#
# **PRIVACY. This is the part that matters, and it happens here rather than in
# the demo, so that no precise coordinate is ever written to disk.**
#
# 311 records are public and each one is a record about a specific address --
# `address`, `service_request_id`, `status_notes` and often a photograph are all
# in the response and none of them are read. Three reductions run before
# anything is stored:
#
#   * **Position is snapped to a grid** of SF311_QUANT_DEG degrees, about 220 m
#     north-south and 175 m east-west at this latitude -- call it two city
#     blocks. The cell is then packed to a pair of small integers against a
#     fixed origin, so the stored value is structurally incapable of holding a
#     street address back. The number was not chosen for privacy alone: the map
#     cityline draws is 270 m to the pixel, so the quantum is smaller than a
#     drawn pixel and costs the picture nothing. A quantisation that is visible
#     is one somebody will be tempted to loosen.
#   * **Time is bucketed** to SF311_BUCKET_MIN minutes, and the exact filing
#     second -- which, with a block, is close to a key -- never leaves here.
#   * **Duplicate (bucket, category, cell) triples collapse to one point.**
#     Three parking complaints on the same block in the same ten minutes are one
#     dot on a wall-sized map whatever the record says, and the exact counts
#     survive in the hourly histogram, which carries no position at all.
#
# **Categories are curated, and two categories of curation are going on.**
#
# `service_name` has a long tail -- 38 distinct values over ninety days, from
# 78,000 street-cleaning calls down to a single "Service Request Copy" -- so the
# first job is bucketing it into six things a legend can name plus an unlabelled
# OTHER. That is presentation.
#
# The second job is not. **Anything whose category names an individual person in
# difficulty is dropped outright and never reaches the cache**, matched on
# SF311_SENSITIVE rather than on an exact name so that a category the city adds
# next year cannot arrive through the OTHER bucket. In practice this is
# "Encampment", which is ten thousand rows a quarter -- about five per cent of
# the day and easily the largest single thing thrown away here. An encampment
# report is a report about where specific unhoused people are sleeping tonight,
# and a labelled dot for it on a wall in a public workshop is a map of
# vulnerable people at a known address. Folding it into OTHER would not fix
# that; only dropping it does. The record carries the keyword list and the
# number of rows it removed, so the panel and anybody reading the cache can see
# what is missing rather than having to trust a comment.
#
# This is the same call the `bikes` panel made about per-bike identifiers: real
# data, compelling picture, and the identifying part destroyed in the fetcher
# where it cannot be recovered by changing the demo.

# The San Francisco Metropolitan Internet Exchange: what is on its backbone
# right now, and how much of it there is. sfmix.py draws the weathermap.
#
# **Three endpoints, all keyless, all the exchange's own.**
#
#   /statistics/map/map.json   the public structure -- sites, metros, and the
#                              inter-metro trunks with their real fibre routes
#                              as coarse lon/lat polylines.
#   /statistics/map/traffic    live bits per second per opaque cable id, with a
#                              24 hour series and a per-member breakdown.
#   /statistics/metrics/?panel=ix_total&range=24h
#                              the aggregate everybody quotes: total ingress
#                              and egress across every member port, 300 s step.
#
# **The generation field is a safety interlock and it is used as one.** Both
# map.json and the traffic feed carry the same `generation` string, and the
# cable ids are opaque *per generation* -- they are rebuilt from scratch every
# time the portal re-runs its NetBox build. Joining traffic from one generation
# onto geometry from another does not fail loudly: it silently drops some links
# and, worse, could colour a trunk with a number belonging to a different one.
# So the two are fetched, compared, and refetched once if they disagree (which
# is the ordinary race -- the builder republished between our two GETs). A
# second disagreement raises, and `fetch()` keeps the last good record.
#
# **What is thrown away here, and why.** The three responses are about 135 KB
# together and almost none of it survives:
#
#   * The twelve *sites* collapse to five *metros*. At the scale this panel
#     draws -- eighty kilometres across two hundred columns, so a third of a
#     kilometre a pixel -- the six Santa Clara facilities are the same pixel,
#     and the six intra-metro cables between them are zero pixels long. The
#     portal's own zoomed-out tier already solved this: `metro_cables` are
#     pre-aggregated inter-metro trunks with their own routes, and traffic is
#     summed onto them exactly the way the portal's frontend does it.
#   * The 24 hour per-link series and the per-member breakdowns go entirely.
#     The panel shows *now* per trunk; the history it shows is the exchange
#     total, which is a different and much smaller series.
#   * The routes are Douglas-Peucker simplified to about a tenth of their
#     vertices. 846 points down to under a hundred, at a tolerance well under
#     one panel pixel, so the drawn line is unchanged.
#   * The ix_total series is bucketed down from 289 points to 97 and carried in
#     megabits rather than bits. Bucket *maximum* rather than mean, and the true
#     peak and its timestamp are carried separately, because the peak is the
#     number an exchange is judged by and a decimation that shaved it would be
#     the one lie this record could tell.
#
# What lands in the cache is about 6 KB.

    a_metro to z_metro, and each member cable carries its own a_site; where a
    member happens to be cabled the other way round its two figures are swapped
    before they are added, so the arrows on the panel point at the direction
    the bits are actually going.
