"""Fetch outside data on a timer; hand it to the demos off a disk cache.

The demos that show live data -- propagation, tides, weather -- cannot fetch
it themselves, and the reason is the scheduler. `ftsched` builds the next
segment on a worker thread while the current one is on the wall, and Python
threads share the GIL, so a `build()` that blocks on a socket does not merely
wait: it stops the render loop from getting the interpreter back. A slow
server would drop frames on the wall, and a hung one would mean the segment
never builds at all. Nobody standing in the workshop should be able to tell
that a NOAA endpoint is having a bad afternoon.

So the network lives here, in a process of its own, on a timer. It writes one
JSON file per product into a cache directory -- and, for the products whose
payload is pixels rather than numbers, one binary sidecar beside it, which on
the wall is written to tmpfs instead of the SD card; see BLOB_DIR.
`load()` reads that directory
and **never touches the network** -- it does not import a HTTP library, and it
returns rather than raises when a file is missing, malformed or ancient.

  $ python3 ftdata.py --list
  $ python3 ftdata.py --once                 # one pass, then exit
  $ python3 ftdata.py --loop 900             # every fifteen minutes

Every record carries `fetched_at`, and `load()` hands back the age alongside
the payload, because **age is part of the data**. A tide clock showing
yesterday's phase, or a propagation panel showing last week's K index, is
worse than one showing nothing: it is confidently wrong, and the wall gives no
hint which it is. Demos are expected to say how old their data is, and to say
so loudly once it stops being worth believing. `describe_age()` is here so
they all phrase it the same way.

#
# The sidecars are the opposite on both counts. A GOES window is 3.5 MB
# rewritten every pass -- 336 MB a day onto the SD card the Pi boots from, by a
# wide margin the heaviest writer on the machine -- and none of it is worth
# surviving a reboot, because imagery more than half an hour old is stale by
# its own TTL. So the pixels go to tmpfs and the metadata stays on disk. On
# betelgeuse that is /run/ftdata, made by `RuntimeDirectory=ftdata` in
# ftdata.service; /run is a 182 MB tmpfs with 181 MB free and the machine has
# 670 MB of RAM to spare, so a window costs about two per cent of one and half
# a per cent of the other. What it costs at boot is one honest no-data card

# Tides and tidal currents, from NOAA CO-OPS. tide.py draws these.
#
# Two things make this different from the solar feed above. The first is that
# a prediction is not an observation: the file is a *forecast* spanning days
# either side of the fetch, so a record several hours old is still telling the
# truth, and the question a demo has to ask is not "how old is this?" but "does
# it still cover now?". Both are answerable -- the age comes from `load()`, the
# span is in the payload -- and tide.py checks both.
#
# The second is the station. These are per-station products, so the name
# carries the station id and `register_*` can be called again for another one;
# FT_TIDE_STATIONS and FT_CURRENT_STATIONS add stations without editing this
# file. San Francisco is only the default because that is where the wall is.
#
# Times are stored as epoch seconds, always. The API can hand back local
# station time, but that is a naive wall-clock string with no offset attached
# and it steps backwards an hour every autumn, so everything here is fetched in
# GMT and converted once. Turning an epoch back into something a human reads is
# the demo's business, and it does it in the *display's* local time -- which is
# the right answer for a wall in the same city as the station, and an honest
# one anywhere else.

# GOES GeoColor imagery, from NESDIS STAR. goes.py plays these as a time lapse.
#
# This is the first product whose payload is not numbers, and it changes what
# the cache has to do. The other records here are a few kilobytes of JSON and
# the fetcher rewrites them wholesale every pass. A frame series cannot work
# that way: the source is a 240 kB JPEG every five minutes, a window of them is
# megabytes, and re-fetching the window each pass would put 70 MB an hour
# through the shop wifi to change three frames.
#
# So two things are different. The fetch is **incremental** -- the record lists
# the frame timestamps it already holds, and a pass downloads only the slots
# that are new and drops the ones that have aged out. And the pixels are
# **cooked before they are stored**: each JPEG is decoded, cropped and resized
# to the panel's exact geometry and only the 61 kB result is kept, so a window
# costs a twentieth of what the JPEGs would and, more to the point, the demo
# never decodes anything. Pillow lives on this side of the wall, in the fetcher
# process, next to the sockets. `goes.py` imports numpy and nothing else.
#
# The frames go in a sidecar (see store_blob) as one (N, H, W, 3) uint8 array;
# the JSON record carries the timestamps, the crop, the geometry and the name
# of the sidecar.
#
# The third difference is where that sidecar lands. 3.5 MB rewritten every pass
# is 336 MB a day at the wall's timer, and on a Pi that is SD card wear for
# pixels whose own TTL calls them stale in half an hour, so the sidecar goes to
# tmpfs and only the record goes to the card. See BLOB_DIR at the top of this
# file; nothing in this section has to know about it, because a record names a
# basename and never a directory.

# The Bay Area wind field, from Open-Meteo. winds.py draws this.
#
# Everything above fetches a *point*: one gauge, one satellite, one index.
# This one has to fetch a **field**, because the thing worth looking at here
# is a gradient -- the Pacific marine layer accelerating through the Golden
# Gate and losing half its speed by the time it is over Oakland. One station
# cannot say that. Happily Open-Meteo takes comma-separated coordinate lists
# and answers with a JSON *list* of location objects, so a grid is one request
# rather than seventy-seven, which is the difference between a polite client
# and an abusive one.
#
# It is free and keyless, so the arithmetic of not abusing it is worth writing
# down. Open-Meteo counts a multi-location request as one call per location:
# 7x11 points, four times an hour, is 7 392 location-calls a day against a
# 10 000/day fair-use budget and 308/hour against a 5 000/hour one. That is
# the whole reason the grid is 77 points and not 200.
#
# Resolution is chosen to match the model rather than to look impressive.
# Requesting 37.81,-122.48 comes back stamped 37.8268,-122.5061 -- the API
# snaps to the model cell and *tells you where it landed* -- and the distinct
# cells in a request like this one sit about 3 km apart, which is NOAA's HRRR
# CONUS grid. Asking for points closer together than that just returns the
# same cell twice, so the payload stores the snapped coordinates, deduplicated:
# the honest statement of where these numbers actually live.
#
# Direction is stored exactly as the API gives it -- **the compass bearing the
# wind is coming FROM**, which is the meteorological convention and the
# opposite of the direction anything drawn on a map should move. Converting it
# is the demo's job and it is the one bug in this whole demo that would look
# entirely plausible on the wall.
