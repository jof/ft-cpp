"""The wall's global state: on/off, brightness, wipe -- and its way into MQTT.

ft_server owns the panel and composites every client onto it, so how bright the
wall is and whether it is showing anything belong to it rather than to any one
client. It exposes those on a unix socket as lines of text. This is the only
thing that speaks that protocol; everything else comes through here.

Why a daemon of its own rather than a few routes inside ftsched:

  The whole point of a global off switch is that it works when the rest is not.
  ftsched drives the rotation on a frame deadline and is BindsTo=ft_server, so
  it restarts whenever the server does; if "turn the wall off" lived in it, the
  switch would be missing exactly when somebody is trying to deal with a
  misbehaving wall. This has no dependency on ftsched at all: it reads it when
  it is there, reports it as absent when it is not, and controls the display
  either way.

  It is also the thing that remembers. ft_server deliberately does not persist
  brightness -- after it drops privileges it can write nowhere, and a dragged
  slider is dozens of commands a second, which is not something to point at an
  SD card. So desired state lives here, and gets re-applied when the generation
  in `get` changes, which is how a server restart is noticed.

Reads are served from a cache refreshed on a timer, never by doing a socket
round trip inside a request. ftsched's web API made the same promise for the
same reason: a phone on bad wifi must not be able to stall anything by holding
a request open. Writes do go straight through, with a timeout, and update the
cache optimistically so a slider does not snap back under the finger.

MQTT is optional. Without paho-mqtt installed this is still a working HTTP
control API; with it, the wall appears in Home Assistant as one device -- a
light for the display itself, and separate entities for the rotation, so that
"off" and "paused" stay different things. See --mqtt-host.

Run:
  python3 ftctl.py --socket /run/ft/control.sock --listen 127.0.0.1:8082
  python3 ftctl.py --mqtt-host mqtt.lan --mqtt-user ha --mqtt-pass ...
