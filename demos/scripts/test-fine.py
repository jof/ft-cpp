"""Checks for fine.py that a screenshot cannot make.

Four things about this demo are load-bearing and none of them are visible in a
still frame:

  1. **It has to be a pure function of t.** The whole reason the fire is a
     scrolled noise field instead of the fire.py simulation is that the
     scheduler builds segments ahead on a worker thread and starts them at
     t=0. A refactor that reintroduces one accumulated variable produces a
     panel that still looks exactly like fire and desyncs on the wall.
  2. **The noise texture has to wrap.** It is scrolled by slicing a doubled
     copy, so if the tile does not join top to bottom there is a seam that
     crosses the panel once per tile and looks like a scanline glitch. The
     tile height is derived from the upsampling factors precisely so this
     cannot drift; the check is here because "derived" is a comment and this
     is a test.
  3. **The dog must not move.** That is the joke. Every pixel of the dog is
     identical in every frame except the two eye rows, and the eyes are only
     ever shut for a blink or a sip. A change that makes the dog jitter, or
     lets the flame composite over its face, is not a bug you would notice in
     a screenshot -- it is a bug you would notice as the panel not being
     funny.
  4. **The punchline has to be fully drawn.** The 3x5 font is measured rather
     than assumed, and this asserts the measurement: every pixel of the glyph
     mask, including the last row, is actually white in the frame at full
     alpha. This is the check that would have caught the bug that once clipped
     the bottom off every capital E on this wall.

Plus the arc itself: the room has to get monotonically worse, and the schedule
of sips and blinks has to be spaced, seeded and identical across builds.
