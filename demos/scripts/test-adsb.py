"""Checks for adsb.py that a screenshot cannot make.

A traffic map has one failure mode that beats every other: **marks moving the
wrong way still look completely plausible**. A track is a bearing clockwise
from true north, the screen is rows-down and columns-right, the map is
stretched three times horizontally, and getting any one of those wrong gives a
beautiful, confident panel full of aircraft flying backwards over a coastline
that is still perfectly correct. Nobody looking at an LED wall from across a
workshop will catch it. So the direction is asserted three ways, each less
forgiving than the last:

  1. against a **synthetic** record -- one aircraft, a known track, a known
     groundspeed -- where the answer is arithmetic and any sign error shows up
     as motion in exactly the wrong direction;
  2. against the **rendered pixels**, by taking the mark's centroid off two
     frames thirty seconds apart and reading a bearing and a speed back off the
     screen, undoing the stretch with the same metres per pixel the demo used
     to apply it;
  3. with a **control** that must fail: the same measurement on a render whose
     velocities have been negated. If a backwards panel passes, nothing above
     is worth anything.

The other thing worth being careful about is that **this demo is not a pure
function of t**. It carries the last frame's ease, the last reload's arrays and
a clock, so every check here renders a *sequence* from a fresh `build()` and
drives the demo's clock itself rather than sampling `render()` at scattered
timestamps. `render.state["now"]` exists for exactly that.

    $ python3 scripts/test-adsb.py                     # uses the live cache
    $ python3 scripts/test-adsb.py --cache-dir /tmp/c  # or a pointed one

Only the last section needs a populated cache; run
`python3 ftdata.py --once --only adsb-bay` first. Everything else writes the
records it wants.
