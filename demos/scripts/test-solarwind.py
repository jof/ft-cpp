"""Checks for solarwind.py that a screenshot cannot make.

This panel can draw a confident, beautiful, wrong picture in five ways, and
none of them look wrong:

  1. **The corridor can run backwards.** The record is oldest-first, and
     oldest means *nearest the Earth*, because that plasma has been travelling
     for an hour. Draw it newest-on-the-right instead and the panel is a
     mirror of the truth: the southward patch that is forty minutes away is
     shown arriving, and the one arriving is shown forty minutes away.
  2. **The magnetosphere can be driven by the wrong end.** It responds to the
     sample arriving now -- element 0 -- not to the headline number measured
     at L1, which will not arrive for another fifty minutes.
  3. **The magnetopause can fail to move.** A Shue curve with the pressure
     term dropped is exactly as pretty and says a storm looks like a quiet
     day, which is the one thing this panel exists to contradict.
  4. **Bz can lose its sign.** North and south are one minus sign apart and
     the entire meaning of the panel is that sign; a comb tilted the wrong way
     is a lovely picture of the opposite fact.
  5. **Speed can stop mattering.** 350 and 700 km/s must not look the same,
     and "the texture scrolls faster" is invisible in a still, so it is
     asserted as pixels-moved-per-second between frames.

So the arithmetic is asserted against the published formulas and the drawing
is asserted **in pixels** against synthetic records whose answers cannot be
argued with -- an all-south field, an all-north one, a quiet day and a storm.

Two things about how these are run, both learned the hard way in this tree.
`ftdata.CACHE_DIR` binds at import, so the three data states a demo must
handle -- fresh, stale, absent -- are each run in a **separate process** with
FT_DATA_CACHE set, at the bottom of this file. And every frame comparison
renders from a fresh `build()`, even though this demo is a pure function of t,
so that a future version which stops being pure fails here rather than on the
wall.

    $ python3 scripts/test-solarwind.py                     # uses the live cache
    $ python3 scripts/test-solarwind.py --cache-dir /tmp/c

The live cache is only needed for the one check against real data; everything
else builds its own cache directory and needs nothing. Populate it with
`python3 ftdata.py --once --only swpc_l1_wind`.
