"""Bake a short looping GIF of each demo, for the ftsched web UI.

A still does not tell you what most of these are. printer and knit are only
legible as motion; splitflap is *entirely* motion; slime and fireflies look
like noise until you see them move. But a full video of two dozen demos is
megabytes over the shop wifi to render a control panel, so this makes the
smallest thing that still reads: two seconds at 8 fps, at the wall's native
320x64, palettised.

These are built on a desktop and committed, NOT generated on the Pi. Building
one costs a demo's whole build() plus a few seconds of rendering, and doing
that for two dozen demos on the Pi 3 while the wall is playing would steal the
CPU the render loop needs. They only change when a demo does.

    #                 barely any real time passes, so it would move nothing: the
    #                 four measure 0.000 to 0.013 mean absolute frame delta over
    #                 a rendered minute. Their clips are therefore stills, and
    #                 honestly so -- an airliner covers about a tenth of a pixel
    #                 in the two seconds a preview lasts, so a still is what
    #                 these panels genuinely look like over that window.
