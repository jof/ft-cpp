"""Checks for helicorder.py and its Steim2 decoder that a screenshot cannot make.

This panel can draw a beautiful, confident, wrong picture in at least five
ways, and every one of them looks exactly like a helicorder:

  1. **The decoder can be subtly wrong.** Steim2 packs its differences
     right-aligned against bit 0, and shifting down from bit 31 instead --
     which is the obvious thing to write, and what the first draft of this did
     -- decodes every record into a plausible-looking wiggle of entirely
     invented numbers. So the decoder is round-tripped here against an encoder
     written for the test, over a series that deliberately uses all seven
     packings, and separately against the reverse integration constant, which
     is the field the format carries for exactly this purpose.
  2. **The drum can be upside down.** Six traces are six traces; newest at the
     top is as pretty as oldest at the top and is a different six hours.
  3. **The scale can be arbitrary.** If the vertical scale followed the data's
     own maximum, a magnitude 5 would look identical to a quiet afternoon and
     the panel would be a picture of nothing. The background must fill a
     predictable fraction of a lane and a burst must clip out of it.
  4. **A gap can draw as a flat line**, which is the panel claiming the ground
     was still when in fact nobody was listening.
  5. **The pen can sit at the right-hand edge** whatever the data says, which
     is a chart drawn to the edge when the fetcher stopped an hour ago.

Two things about how these are run, both learned the hard way in this tree.
Every check renders frames **sequentially from a fresh `build()`**, because
the demo reveals itself over the first few seconds. And `ftdata.CACHE_DIR`
binds at import, so the three data states -- fresh, stale, absent -- are each
run in a **separate process** with FT_DATA_CACHE set, at the bottom of this
file.

    $ python3 scripts/test-helicorder.py
    $ python3 scripts/test-helicorder.py --cache-dir /tmp/c

The live cache is only needed for the checks against real data; everything
else builds its own cache directory and needs nothing. Populate it with
`python3 ftdata.py --once --only helicorder-bk`.

    The baseline was a running *mean* of the column midpoints. An M3.8 in San
