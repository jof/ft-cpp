"""This is fine.

A dog in a hat sits at a small table with a cup of coffee, in a room that is
slowly filling with fire. It blinks. Now and then it lifts the cup and takes a
sip. The room gets steadily worse. Nothing else happens, and that is the joke:
the whole gag is the *calm*, so the one rule this demo has is that the dog
never reacts. If it flinched, or if the cup rattled, the panel would be a dog
in trouble instead of a dog insisting everything is under control.

The scene is drawn here from a description, not copied: the dog, the hat, the
table and the cup are character grids with a palette, in the same way mario.py
and nyancat.py build their sprites, and the room -- back wall, doorway, picture
frame, shelf, floorboards -- is painted with rectangles at build time. Nothing
is traced and nothing is downloaded.

The fire is the engineering problem. The classic demoscene fire in fire.py is
*inherently* stateful: each frame takes the heat buffer left by the previous
one, shifts it up and cools it. A demo like that cannot be a pure function of
`t`, and the scheduler builds segments ahead on a worker thread and starts them
at t=0, so anything accumulating between render() calls desyncs. Re-running N
simulation steps from a fixed seed every frame would restore purity but costs N
times a whole-panel pass, which is out of the question on a Pi.

So the flame here is a *field*, not a simulation:

    heat(y, x, t) = clip(fuel(x, stage) * turbulence(x, y + scroll(t)) - b(y))

`turbulence` is one wrapping noise texture baked once in build(): a low
resolution random field, upsampled, sheared so its streaks lean, and blurred by
wrapping rolls so it tiles top to bottom. Scrolling it upward at a fixed rate
is what makes tongues rise; because it wraps, the scroll is a plain array slice
at `int(t * speed) % TILE_H` and costs nothing. `b(y)` is height above the floor
line, so subtracting it is what gives every column a flame that runs out at some
height; `fuel(x, stage)` is a per-column fuel profile, baked once per lighting
stage, which is what walks the fire from one corner to the whole room. The
result is a pure function of t, six whole-panel numpy calls, and it reads as
fire because the palette carries it -- exactly the reason fire.py maps a scalar
field through a ramp rather than computing RGB.

The room's lighting is the other half of "the room is on fire". It is baked, not
computed: build() paints the room twice, clean and charred, and then renders
--stages fully lit frames interpolating between them, each with the orange
bounce light and the ceiling smoke for that point in the arc. A frame picks one
by index, so the whole room costs a single copy. The dog and the cup are baked
the same way, lit from the same field sampled at the sprite's own rows, so the
character sits *in* the light rather than on top of it.

The arc, over --cycle seconds: a little flame in the corner; fire along the
walls and up through the doorway; the whole room, hat slightly singed; and then
the line, once, at the beat where it is funniest -- which is after you have had
long enough to notice the dog has not moved.
