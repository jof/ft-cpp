"""Driving west into a San Francisco sunset.

The Great Highway out towards Ocean Beach: a road running away to a vanishing
point over the Pacific, the sun going down into the water with its glitter
path pointing back at you, Sutro Tower silhouetted on the ridge off to the
left, and Karl the Fog rolling in off the ocean to swallow it.

Built the way floor.py is. Every screen row below the horizon looks at the
water at one fixed depth, so depth, the step across the wave texture, the
road's width in pixels, the dashes' visibility and the distance haze are all
per-row constants worked out once. The sky is stronger still: it only changes
when the sun has sunk a quarter of a pixel or the ridge has drifted a whole
one, so it is baked and re-used for a second or two at a time. A frame is
then one gather, a few whole-array multiply-adds, and a cast.

Run:  python3 sunset.py --host 127.0.0.1
      python3 sunset.py --speed 24 --fog 1.4 --sun 0.7
      python3 sunset.py --no-fog --no-tower --dither 0
