"""A Risograph duplicator printing, seen along the paper path.

A Riso is a stencil duplicator: one drum per ink colour, and a multi-colour
print means running the same sheet through the machine once for every colour.
Its entire visual identity comes from that one fact. Each pass lands a pixel or
two off from the last, so edges fringe and overlaps shift, and the inks are
soy-based and semi-transparent, so where two of them land on top of each other
they multiply -- fluorescent pink over blue is purple, and the whole secondary
palette comes out of the physics rather than out of a colour picker.

The representation
------------------
The artwork is never an image. It is **N separate ink channels**, one per
colour, each a coverage map in 0..1 over the printable area of the sheet, and
"rendering" is compositing those channels with a per-pass integer offset and a
multiply blend:

    sheet = paper
    for each channel k:
        sheet[shift(screen(cov_k), dy_k, dx_k)] *= (1 - d) + d * ink_k / 255

Everything else falls out of that. Misregistration is the shift. Overprint
colour is the multiply -- there is no table of "pink over blue is purple"
anywhere in this file, it just happens. And the state of the sheet after k
passes is the k-th partial product, so `build()` bakes the whole cumulative
stack once, K+1 finished sheet images, and a frame that is halfway through
laying the third colour is literally `cum[3]` to the left of the drum and
`cum[2]` to the right of it. Two blits. That is the whole print engine.

Halftone
--------
Riso screens are coarse and openly visible -- a real one is around 45 degrees
and you can count the dots -- so every channel is thresholded through an angled
dot screen before it is composited, each channel on its own angle the way a
real separation is, to keep the passes from moiring against each other. Flat
areas stay flat (coverage 1 beats every threshold), and a ramp turns into a
visible field of dots, which is what makes the print read as printed rather
than as a drawn rectangle.

The machine
-----------
The panel is the paper path, left to right: feed deck, the ink drum in the
middle, catch tray at the right. A sheet slides out of the feed deck, passes
under the drum, and the ink wipes onto it *at the nip* -- the column where the
drum touches the paper -- so the new colour arrives as a left-to-right wipe
across a sheet that is already carrying the previous ones. Then it sits in the
catch tray long enough to be looked at, whips back to the feed deck, and goes
again. Between passes the drum is swapped (it drops out of frame and comes back
a different colour) and a new master is burnt on the thermal head, because on a
real Riso every colour needs both.

Colour
------
The inks are the real published Riso colours by their actual hex values.  Not
all of them survive an LED wall: multiply is a darkening operator, so a dark
ink over anything is nearly black, and Federal Blue, Black, Teal and Purple are
excluded from the default set for that reason (--inks will put them back). The
passes are also ordered lightest-first, which is what a real print shop does
and which here keeps the last, darkest colour reading as type on top of a
field rather than as mud.

Determinism
-----------
The job list -- artwork, inks, and the registration offset of every pass -- is
drawn once in build() from --seed and baked into a timeline. render() is a pure
function of t: it finds which segment t lands in and evaluates that segment.
