"""The control server for ftsched: a small JSON API and the page that drives it.

Deliberately boring. It is stdlib http.server on a daemon thread, and every
route is a read of something already computed -- the snapshot the render loop
published, the option schemas read off the demos at startup -- or a command
pushed onto a queue. It never renders, never touches the rotation directly,
and never holds a lock the frame loop wants: a client on a bad phone
connection cannot stall the wall, and neither can a hundred of them.

There is no authentication. This is a wall in a makerspace and the server is
meant to be reachable from anyone's phone on the shop wifi; the worst anyone
can do is change what is on the wall, which is the entire point of it. Do not
expose it to the internet -- bind it to the LAN or to a Tailscale address.

The page is served from ftsched_ui.html next door, read per request so it can
be edited against a running daemon. It is a couple of KB and the request rate
is one page load per person, so caching it would be optimising the wrong side.
