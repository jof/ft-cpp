"""Outside, right here: what was measured, what was modelled, kept apart.

The wall is at 1736 18th Street and the panel is about the weather *at* 1736
18th Street, which turns out to be a harder claim to make honestly than it
sounds. There is exactly one real instrument anywhere near the building --
SFOC1, "San Francisco Downtown", 2.8 km north-west -- and it reports
temperature, dewpoint and humidity and nothing else. No wind. No pressure. Not
"sometimes no wind": the fields are in the JSON and they are `null`, every
hour, with a `Z` quality flag. Everything else on this panel -- wind, pressure,
cloud, air quality -- is a **model's output for this address**, computed rather
than sensed. Every keyed alternative was tried and none of them are keyless any
more: Weather Underground PWS 401s, PurpleAir 403s, Synoptic 401s, AirNow 401s.

So the panel is a composite, and a composite that blended the two into one
authoritative-looking readout would be worse than no panel at all. Somebody who
reads the wall and then decides whether to roll the door up is entitled to know
which numbers came off a thermometer and which came out of a supercomputer in
Norway. **That distinction is the design**, and it is carried four ways at once,
because any one of them fails on somebody:

  1. *Position.* Measured things live left of the first hairline. Modelled
     things live right of it. Nothing crosses.
  2. *A word.* Each zone is headed OBSERVED or MODELLED, with the instrument
     and its distance, or the model and whose it is, beside it.
  3. *Colour.* Observed values are near-white; modelled values are blue. Two
     hues, not two brightnesses, so dimming a stale source cannot erase it.
  4. *A mark on every number.* A modelled value is printed `~5.4`, the way one
     writes an approximation by hand. Crop the panel, photograph it, read it
     colour-blind, and the tilde is still there.

The tilde is on the AQI too, which is the number most likely to be read off
this wall and acted on -- during fire season a woodworker deciding about the
roll-up door reads that and nothing else. It gets the biggest colour on the
panel, on the EPA's own scale, and it still says `~55`, because CAMS modelling
a 0.1-degree cell over the Mission is not the same thing as a sensor on the
roof. When one *is* on the roof, the tilde comes off by itself; see below.

**The temperatures are shown twice on purpose.** Observed 2.8 km away, modelled
here, and the difference between them printed underneath. In this city that
difference is not an error, it is the sea breeze: a panel that showed one
number would be hiding the most interesting thing it knows.

**Nothing here touches the network.** `build()` reads a disk cache written by
`ftdata.py` in another process, because the scheduler builds the next segment
on a worker thread sharing the GIL with the render loop -- a `build()` that
blocks on a socket stops the wall for everybody. See ftdata.py's docstring.
That file is also where met.no's terms are honoured: identifying User-Agent
with a contact address, Expires respected, conditional requests, no polling
faster than the model changes.

**Staleness, in propagation.py's three stages**, and with its vocabulary, since
this panel sits in the same rotation and a second vocabulary would be a second
thing to learn. Fresh: full brightness. Past TTL: half brightness, amber age,
AGING. Past three TTLs: the numbers are withdrawn -- `--`, never a plausible
zero -- and a red STALE flag blinks. The ages are the data's own, not the
fetch's: a met.no record revalidated with a 304 has a new `fetched_at` and
hour-old contents, and it is the contents that matter. An empty cache is a
NO DATA card naming the fetcher and its command.

**The distinction survives all of that**, which is the part worth testing: a
stale zone keeps its header, keeps its hue, and keeps every tilde. It has
nothing to say and says so in the right voice.

**It is all baked.** The layout, the type, the compass arrow and the AQI block
are rasterised once in `build()`; `render()` copies that frame and repaints two
small rectangles -- the stale flag and a heartbeat. A Pi 3 throttled to 600 MHz
re-lays no type at all here. Ten frames a second by default, because there are
exactly two distinct frames and the other twenty would be identical datagrams.
