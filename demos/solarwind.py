"""The solar wind in flight, from the Sun's limb to the Earth's magnetosphere.

This is the one subject on the wall that is *natively* 5:1: the Sun-Earth line
is a line, and everything interesting about space weather happens along it. So
the panel is that line, drawn left to right, and it is a picture rather than a
readout. `propagation.py` already puts these numbers on the wall -- SFI, Kp,
Bz, wind speed, in tiles, for a ham deciding on a band -- and a second panel of
the same numbers would be a duplicate. What a table of numbers cannot show is
*where the plasma is*, which way the field in it is pointing, and what it is
about to do to the Earth. That is what this draws.

**The one representation choice: x is distance, which is also time.** SWPC
publishes `propagated-solar-wind-1-hour.json`, an hour of one-minute samples
measured at L1 with, for each, the time it will reach the bow shock. At normal
wind speeds that trip takes about fifty minutes -- so the file is almost
exactly the plasma currently *in flight*. Its oldest row is arriving at the
magnetosphere about now; its newest was measured a minute ago, a million and a
half kilometres upstream. Lay those rows out with the oldest on the right and
the newest on the left and you have not drawn a chart with a time axis: you
have drawn the corridor, with the plasma in it, in the right places. Everything
else on the panel falls out of that. The stream flows rightward because the
plasma does. A southward patch of field sits at the x where that plasma
actually is. The magnetosphere is squeezed by the sample arriving *now*, which
is the right-hand end of the record and not the headline number.

**Honest about scale, which it cannot be.** The corridor is one hour of
travel, roughly 0.01 AU. The remaining 99% of the way to the Sun is not drawn;
the Sun's limb at the left edge is an emblem of where the wind came from, not a
body at its true distance, which would be a hundred panels away. The Earth is
drawn about four times oversized so that an aurora can be more than one pixel,
and the magnetosphere is at 1.55 px per Earth radius around it. Everything
*within* the magnetosphere is to that one scale, so the compression is real
even though the corridor's scale is not.

**The magnetopause is the Shue model, not a doodle.** Shue et al. (1997) fit
the standoff distance and flaring of the magnetopause to two numbers:

    r0    = (10.22 + 1.29 tanh(0.184 (Bz + 8.14))) * Dp^(-1/6.6)
    alpha = (0.58 - 0.007 Bz) (1 + 0.024 ln Dp)
    r(t)  = r0 (2 / (1 + cos t))^alpha

with dynamic pressure Dp = 1.6726e-6 n v^2 in nPa. On a quiet day that puts the
nose at 10.2 Earth radii; at 20 nPa and Bz -20 it puts it at 5.6, and on the
panel the whole cavity visibly caves in. The bow shock is drawn at 1.3 r0,
which is the usual rule of thumb rather than a model, and the magnetosheath
between the two is the brightest plasma on the panel because shocked plasma
piles up there -- which is exactly what the real thing looks like from a
spacecraft. When the nose has moved in by more than a couple of radii a dotted
ghost of the quiet-day magnetopause stays behind, so the compression is
readable in a single frame instead of needing a memory of yesterday.

**The chain the panel exists to teach.** Southward Bz -- the field lines
tilting down rather than up -- is what lets the solar wind couple into the
magnetosphere. So when the field arriving at the nose is southward, the dashes
turn from cool blue to hot magenta, sparks appear at the subsolar magnetopause
and run back along the flanks into the tail, the tail's X-line flashes, and a
beat later the poles light up. North field: the dashes are blue, the flanks are
quiet, the poles are a dim smudge. Nobody has to read that; it is a picture of
a cause and an effect, and it is the thing `propagation.py` cannot draw.

**Text is three numbers.** Wind speed with its unit, Bz with its sign, Kp.
Everything else is drawn. The age of the data is in the bottom right corner
always, because a picture of the solar wind that is six hours old is a lie told
confidently, and past three TTLs the panel greys out and stops quoting numbers
altogether.

**How it is cheap enough for the Pi.** The whole panel is a uint8 *index*
image through one 256-entry palette, split into bands -- plasma 0..63, north
field 64..95, south field 96..127, and so on -- so every layer composites in
integers and colour happens exactly once, in a single `np.take`. The streaming
plasma is a seeded streak texture, baked once, made periodic in the panel width
and stored twice side by side: scrolling it is a *slice*, not a roll and not a
take, and it costs nothing. Everything static -- the Sun, the field dashes, the
Shue curves, the type -- is baked into one overlay and stamped in with a single
`np.copyto(where=)`. That leaves five whole-panel numpy calls a frame plus a
dozen writes of a handful of pixels each for the sparks and the aurora.
