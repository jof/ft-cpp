# Demos

Effects for a FlaschenTaschen display. The Python ones here are numpy demos
that push whole frames; the C++ ones live in [`src/`](src/) and are built with
`make`.

```console
$ python3 fire.py --host 127.0.0.1
$ python3 tunnel.py --texture checker --palette magma
$ python3 metaballs.py --balls 8 --palette toxic --contour 6
```

Every demo takes `--host`, `--port`, `--width`, `--height`, `--layer`,
`--band`, `--fps` and `--duration`; `--duration` auto-stops, so a launched
stream can never become a runaway flooder. `--help` lists the rest, and most
take `--palette`.

Requirements: numpy, plus Pillow for `scroller.py`, and the `flaschen` client
from [`../api/python`](../api/python) (`pip install ./api/python`, or just run
from a clone — the demos fall back to the checkout).

No display to hand? [`../tools/ft-emulator`](../tools/ft-emulator) is a server that
renders to a browser instead of hardware, which is how the screenshots below
were taken.

## megademo

![megademo](screenshots/megademo.png)

Plays the effects back to back as one continuous show, with real transitions
instead of hard cuts, and a scrolling banner over the bottom. Both effects are
live during a transition and their frames are blended; the type is chosen per
boundary, because a sparse effect crossfaded under a busy one is invisible and
wants a fade through black instead.

Effects are built on a worker thread a couple of segments ahead. Building
everything up front means a slow black start and every table resident at once;
building at the transition stalls visibly, since `scroller` bakes for seconds.

```console
$ python3 megademo.py --playlist "fire:20,tunnel:15:wipe,water:12+drops=4"
$ python3 megademo.py --no-banner --segment 25 --transition 3
```

## The effects

### fire

![fire](screenshots/fire.png)

Doom-style fire: a row of burning fuel along the bottom, and every frame each
cell takes the heat of the cell below it, shifted sideways at random and
cooled a little. The randomness is what turns a smooth gradient into flames.
Done as one vectorized step over the whole buffer.

```console
$ python3 fire.py --palette ice --wind -0.4 --cool 4
```

### tunnel

![tunnel](screenshots/tunnel.png)

For every pixel, the angle around the centre and a depth that grows as you
approach it, used as texture coordinates. Scrolling the depth flies you
forward; scrolling the angle rolls the tunnel. Both depend only on the pixel,
so they are computed once and each frame is two integer adds, a mask and a
gather.

```console
$ python3 tunnel.py --texture rings --speed 120 --roll -0.3
```

### starfield

![starfield](screenshots/starfield.png)

Stars drift towards the camera and are divided by their depth, so one crawls
while it is far away and then sweeps past. Each is drawn several times along
the distance it covered during the frame, which is what makes the streaks.

```console
$ python3 starfield.py --stars 800 --speed 1.6 --warp 6 --tint ice
```

### metaballs

![metaballs](screenshots/metaballs.png)

Each ball contributes a field that falls off with distance; the fields are
summed and coloured through a palette. Because the sum is smooth, two balls
approaching each other bulge and merge into one shape rather than overlapping
— which is the point, and something you cannot get by drawing circles.

```console
$ python3 metaballs.py --balls 8 --palette toxic --contour 6
```

### rotozoom

![rotozoom](screenshots/rotozoom.png)

Rotate and scale a tiled texture by working backwards: for each pixel on
screen, apply the inverse transform to find where it lands in the texture.
Every pixel then gets exactly one sample with no gaps to fill, which is why
the effect was cheap enough for hardware that could not multiply quickly.

```console
$ python3 rotozoom.py --texture xor --spin 0.35 --zoom-min 0.4
```

### laser

![laser](screenshots/laser.png)

A laser cutter working through a job: a searing head tracing a vector path,
the kerf cooling behind it, and the piece dropping out when the outline
closes.

One scalar heat field carries all of it — the head writes 1.0 along the arc it
covered this frame, the field decays, and a black→red→orange→white ramp turns
it into kerf, trail and head bloom together. Cooling is a half-life in
*seconds* rather than a per-frame factor, so the trail is the same length in
wall time whether the demo runs at 8 fps or 30.

Paths are generated — gears, finger-jointed panels, filigree, slot lettering —
cut holes first, outline last, with dark rapid moves between contours and the
head stepping in arc length so corners do not speed up.

Heat alone cannot tell what belongs to the part, since lettering cut ten
seconds ago has already decayed out of the ramp, so a per-job cut mask relights
the whole piece for the second it takes to fall.

```console
$ python3 laser.py --cool 2.0 --shapes gear,filigree
```

### printer

![printer](screenshots/printer.png)

A 3D printer seen side-on: gantry climbing a row per layer, nozzle glowing,
part rising with visible infill — and sometimes failing into spaghetti.

Silhouettes are functions of normalised coordinates rather than sprites, so
they rasterise to whatever height the panel gives. Each layer is classified
into perimeter, skin and infill, and only the infill stencil is drawn, which is
why the cross-section is a lattice rather than a filled outline.

Failure is two independent draws per print — whether, and then independently
where, anywhere from 8% to 94% of the way up. Over 148 prints that gave 29.7%
failures spread evenly across the height; an early failure leaves nothing but
nest, a late one leaves a near-complete part with strands draped over it.

The spaghetti took three attempts. The coil phase has to come off one clock
shared by the whole strand: sampled per point it is confetti, and tied to
emission rate it is a smooth rope. Only the shared clock gives loose curling
filament.

```console
$ python3 printer.py --fail-rate 0.15 --speed 1.4
```

### knit

![knit](screenshots/knit.png)

An Aran cable sweater worked stitch by stitch. A knitting chart is already a
pixel grid — colourwork and cable charts are low-resolution raster art — so
stitches are 5x5 sprites blitted from source data, never drawn as curves.

What sells it is that the work is visibly *happening*: the row advances a
stitch at a time with jitter and hesitations, needles meet at the live stitch
with loops hanging from them, and rows alternate direction the way hand
knitting actually does. Cable crossings animate as the cable-needle move — the
front pair lifts clear leaving a shadowed hole, the other pair slides through,
the held pair drops into the vacated columns.

The chart is generated: counting cable ropes to the left of a stitch identifies
its rhombus, and the parity of that count is a checkerboard over the lattice,
which is what alternates seed-filled diamonds with reverse stockinette.

```console
$ python3 knit.py --diamond 14 --stitch-rate 9
```

### wheel

![wheel](screenshots/wheel.png)

A bicycle drivetrain: three-cross laced wheel, chainring and cranks, chain
tracking both sprockets. Gear ratio is derived rather than tuned — both
sprockets share a chain pitch, so pitch radii follow from tooth counts and the
ratio falls out.

All spokes of a flange are tangent to one circle about the hub, so the tangent
angle for a pixel at `(r, a)` is `a ∓ arccos(d/r)`. That is baked once; a frame
reduces it modulo the spoke spacing, with no loop over spokes.

The moiré is the point, not an artifact. Thin spokes crossing a discrete pixel
grid genuinely strobe, and `--sweep` walks the rotation rate through the speeds
where the pattern stalls, crawls and reverses. The rim reflector cannot alias,
so it keeps sweeping while the spokes stand still — which is what makes the
illusion read as an illusion rather than a paused demo.

```console
$ python3 wheel.py --speed 5.0 --sweep 0 --spokes 32
```

### sunset

![sunset](screenshots/sunset.png)

Driving west into a San Francisco sunset: sliced sun low over the Pacific,
glitter on the water, road running to the vanishing point, Sutro Tower on a
headland, Karl rolling in.

The sun is sliced with horizontal gaps that widen downward — the retro
treatment, and also the right call for a panel that bands in the dark end,
since deliberate horizontal structure reads as intentional where accidental
contouring does not.

Two things that only showed up by looking: distance haze on a gentle ramp
smeared the sky's reflection over the whole plane and the ocean read as wet
tarmac, fixed by confining it to a hard band a few rows deep at the horizon;
and a depth-scrolled water texture cannot win at this size — tight enough for
foreground crests, it aliases to hash across the mid field — so the swell is
one sine of each row's depth instead.

```console
$ python3 sunset.py --sun 0.8 --fog 0.4 --no-tower
```

### grove

![grove](screenshots/grove.png)

Drifting through a sequoia grove: trunks running off the top of the frame,
warm shafts angling between them, fog in the gaps. You see a slice, not whole
trees, which is what standing in a grove actually looks like.

Bark is sampled at `arcsin(x/half)` — the true angle around the cylinder — so
fibres crowd toward the silhouette and the trunk reads as round rather than as
a flat bar. Depths are spaced geometrically, because linear spacing puts
everything in the middle distance where the parallax rates are indistinguishable.

Shafts carry a depth too, so occlusion is free: a nearer trunk blitted
afterwards interrupts the beam, and that interruption is what makes the light
feel three-dimensional. Nothing is blurred at run time — softness is baked into
the sprites.

```console
$ python3 grove.py --speed 6 --shafts 3 --fog 1.4
```

### goldengate

![goldengate](screenshots/goldengate.png)

The bridge standing out of the fog. Geometry comes from the real thing in feet
— 4200 ft main span, 526 ft of tower over a 220 ft deck — at one pixels-per-foot
scale that happens to serve both axes of a 320x64 panel.

The detail that stops it reading as a generic suspension bridge is that the
main cable's vertex sits *on* the deck at midspan. Stepped Art Deco setbacks,
portal braces whose openings shorten going up, and single-pixel suspenders
every 6 px do the rest.

Fog is two tileable noise tiles scrolled across each other, windowed by a
rolling edge and a travelling bank envelope, with density tied to bank height
so a high bank is a thick one. The level clamps at both ends rather than
wandering mid-range — otherwise you get permanent haze instead of weather, and
never the frame where only the tower tops show.

```console
$ python3 goldengate.py --time-of-day 6 --day-cycle 0 --fog 0.8
```

### karl

![karl](screenshots/karl.png)

Karl the Fog over the Twin Peaks ridgeline, swallowing Sutro Tower and letting
it go again. The calmest thing here — a full cycle from clear to buried takes
minutes.

Two noise textures scrolled at different rates and weighted differently by row,
with the detail layer's sample position displaced by the coarse layer. That
domain warping is what makes it curl rather than slide, and it costs a gather
rather than a simulation.

Density comes off the clock as three sines at incommensurate periods, saturated
at the ends so it *dwells* buried and then dwells clear instead of passing
through both.

Worth knowing if you touch the compositing: on this hardware, broadcasting an
`(H,W,1)` against an `(H,W,3)` is about four times slower than doing the same
arithmetic three times on contiguous planes.

```console
$ python3 karl.py --density 1.3 --speed 0.6 --no-tower
```

### slime

![slime](screenshots/slime.png)

A Physarum transport network. Sixteen thousand agents each sense the trail
ahead of them at three angles, turn toward the strongest, move, and deposit;
the trail map is blurred and decayed each step. Nothing draws the network — the
filaments, junctions and loops are what those rules settle into.

Three departures from the textbook rule, each fixing a specific failure:

*Capping* the trail map stops it being winner-take-all. Uncapped, the busiest
strand reads brightest, out-attracts its neighbours, and within a minute two
fat strands hold the entire population.

*Food* — weak, slowly drifting attractant sources — is the one that matters
most. Even capped and well tuned, the network **relaxes**: strands merge, bends
straighten, and after a few minutes all that is left is motionless vertical
lines, which are the shortest closed paths a wrapping 64-row canvas admits. No
decay value fixes that; it is the end state of the tuning rather than a failure
of it. Foraging forces junctions that relaxation cannot remove, and moving
sources keep it re-solving.

*Spore batches* nucleate new colonies that grow and fuse while starved branches
prune. They have to be a batch in one place and facing outward — scattered
agents just join the nearest strand, and random headings give a trapped orbit
that shows as permanent confetti.

`--deposit` is expressed as the resulting equilibrium mean trail value, with
the per-agent amount derived from it, so changing agent count or decay does not
move the brightness — only the sharpness of pruning. Decay 0.94 is about
sixteen steps of memory; 0.98 floods to a uniform lit field in twenty seconds
and 0.85 never organises at all.

The trail is seeded with blurred noise and given a few hundred warmup steps
inside `build()`, so frame zero is already a network rather than something you
wait for.

```console
$ python3 slime.py --agents 24000 --sensor-dist 5 --palette ice
```

### fireflies

![fireflies](screenshots/fireflies.png)

A field of oscillators that spontaneously synchronise. Each firefly has its own
natural rate and flashes when its phase wraps; coupling pulls it toward its
neighbours, and out of that come waves of synchrony that sweep across the panel
and collide.

Coupling is deliberately **local**, not mean-field. Mean-field is cheaper, but
the whole field then snaps into unison at once, which is far duller to watch —
local coupling is what produces travelling waves, and a 5:1 panel is the right
shape to see them cross. Each phase is splatted as a unit vector into a coarse
grid, the grid is blurred, and the result sampled back at each position: O(N)
plus a small blur, with the blur radius acting as the coupling range.
Normalising by the blurred *count* makes the pull depend on how much a
neighbourhood agrees rather than how crowded it is, so a synchronised patch
recruits its border.

Two things keep it from going static, which is the real design problem — a
fully locked field is as boring as a scattered one. The frequency spread is
wide enough that full lock is unreachable, and the natural frequencies
themselves drift, so there is no fixed consensus to converge on: leaders change
and every truce eventually breaks. Measured over five minutes the global order
parameter roams 0.08 to 0.84 indefinitely, reaching 0.8 within twenty seconds
from a cold start, so a short slot still shows the arc. With `--coupling 0` it
sits at 0.05 and never organises, which is the control worth keeping in mind.

```console
$ python3 fireflies.py --coupling 2.5 --range 40 --no-grass
```

### mario

![mario](screenshots/mario.png)

A self-playing side-scrolling platformer: a little plumber runs right through
an endlessly generated level, jumping pipes and gaps, collecting coins and
stomping the odd goomba, over three layers of parallax.

The background is a sequoia grove rather than the round two-lobed bushes the
genre expects — cinnamon trunks bare for two thirds of their height, the
nearest of them running off the top of the panel. They are the only scenery at
the character's own scale, so they are what the scene reads as; the level in
front of them stays eight-bit. Trees are stamped into one wide strip at two
depths, the far ones shorter and blended toward the sky, and the strip is
scrolled by slicing, so the whole grove costs one wrapped blit a frame.

Uses 8 px tiles with a two-tile character rather than classic 16 px ones. At
16 the panel is four tiles: ground plus character leaves under a tile of
headroom and there is no jump arc at all. At 8 it is eight tiles — one ground,
two character, five of air — which is what makes a three-tile pipe clearable.
`--scale 2` gives real 16 px tiles and demonstrates the problem: no pipe
height passes the clearance test, so the generator emits only gaps.

The level generator is bounded by the physics rather than tuned by hand.
`build()` derives the airtime and horizontal reach of a jump, then admits an
obstacle only if the actual trajectory clears it at *both* edges of its span —
the apex is over the middle, so the edges are the tight part — and leaves more
than one jump's reach of flat ground between obstacles. That is what stops it
ever generating something unclearable, which on an unattended wall would strand
the character hours later.

```console
$ python3 mario.py --density 0.6 --speed 70 --run-fps 14
```

### nyancat

![nyancat](screenshots/nyancat.png)

The pop-tart cat, trailing a rainbow through twinkling stars. The sprite lives
in the source as rows of characters with a palette per character, so it can be
edited in a diff rather than shipped as an image; moving parts (four tail
poses, the paws) are separate grids composed into the six loop frames at
startup and scaled with `np.repeat`.

The sprite animates on its own clock (`--cat-fps`, default 10) rather than the
display rate — the original is much slower than a display refresh, and tying
the two together makes it look wrong at any frame rate but one. The trail is
baked a whole square-wave period wider than the panel, so scrolling it is a
slice at an offset.

A 320x64 panel is close to the ideal shape for this: the cat sits right of
centre and the rainbow reaches the far edge.

```console
$ python3 nyancat.py --cat-x 0.4 --speed 40 --no-stars
```

### floor

![floor](screenshots/floor.png)

A Mode-7 perspective plane: gradient sky with a sun, a horizon, and textured
ground receding to it, with forward motion and a slow steer. Each screen row
below the horizon is at a constant distance, so per-row depth, texture step,
mip level and fog are all precomputed and a frame costs an add, a truncate and
one gather. An anisotropic mip chain kills the fish-scale moire that otherwise
covers the mid field, since a row near the horizon spans hundreds of texels of
depth while stepping a fraction of one across.

```console
$ python3 floor.py --texture road --palette magma --speed 90
```

### cycle

![cycle](screenshots/cycle.png)

Colour-cycled plasma. The image is computed exactly once and the animation is
entirely the palette rotating under it — the classic technique, and about ten
times cheaper per frame than anything else here at 0.05 ms. The palette must
be *cyclic* or every wrap shows as a seam sweeping across the panel, so the
non-cyclic ramps are mirrored to close the loop.

```console
$ python3 cycle.py --pattern spiral --palette rainbow --bands 3
```

### water

![water](screenshots/water.png)

A damped wave equation with drops falling on it, rendered by refraction rather
than by colouring height: the local slope offsets a lookup into a background,
so the surface bends what is beneath it. Uses a nine-point isotropic Laplacian
— the usual four-neighbour stencil makes ripples spread as diamonds and sits
right on the stability limit. Boundaries are fixed rather than wrapping, so
ripples reflect instead of reappearing on the far edge.

```console
$ python3 water.py --background grid --drops 5 --refract 34
```

### fireworks

![fireworks](screenshots/fireworks.png)

Shells launch, arc up and burst into sparks that fall and fade. One fixed-size
particle pool in flat arrays, updated with whole-array operations and recycled
through dead slots, so every frame costs the same. Trails come from a decay
buffer. Spark speed is the load-bearing parameter: below about a pixel per
frame the sparks creep and the decay buffer paints a solid disc instead of
rays, so speed and drag have to be raised together.

```console
$ python3 fireworks.py --rate 3 --types willow,crackle --palette ice
```

### boing

![boing](screenshots/boing.png)

The Amiga Boing Ball: a red and white checkered sphere spinning about a tilted
axis, bouncing in a purple wireframe room. The silhouette and the surface
coordinates of every pixel are precomputed once, so a frame is an add, an xor
and a masked blit. Checker counts derive from the radius and are forced even,
so the equator lands on a cell boundary and the pattern stays consistent
across the longitude wrap.

```console
$ python3 boing.py --radius 24 --segments 16 --bands 8
```

### daliclock

![daliclock](screenshots/daliclock.png)

A clock whose digits melt into each other. Seven-segment glyphs are generated
rather than loaded from a font, and the morph interpolates their signed
distance fields and re-thresholds — so the outline moves and you get one solid
deforming figure, where a crossfade would give two superimposed glyphs at half
brightness. Time is read from the system clock inside the frame callback, so
the melt stays locked to the second rather than drifting with frame rate.

```console
$ python3 daliclock.py --12h --palette green --morph 0.6
```

### splitflap

![splitflap](screenshots/splitflap.png)

A split-flap departures board. Changing a letter riffles through *every*
intervening card in a fixed stack order, so blank→Z takes 26 flips and blank→B
takes two — that staggering, plus per-cell rate jitter and start delay, is what
makes the board ripple instead of switching in unison.

The flip is a real mechanism, not a crossfade: the outgoing glyph's top half
squashes toward the seam while the incoming glyph's top arrives above it, so
mid-flip a cell legitimately shows two different characters with a hard dark
seam between them. Past ninety degrees you see the card's back, which is the
incoming bottom half unfolding downward. Foreshortening is a nearest-neighbour
row resample rather than a blur, which at 64 rows would turn to mush.

Every squashed step of every card is baked at startup, so a frame is a handful
of small blits and settled cells are never touched — it is the cheapest demo
here by a wide margin. Glyphs are a 5x7 bitmap font in the source, no font file.

`{TIME}` and `{DATE}` are substituted live, so it can be a clock as well as a
sign.

```console
$ python3 splitflap.py --messages "SEQUOIA FABRICA|OPEN HOUSE {TIME};MAKE THINGS|ASK ANYONE" --hold 12
```

### scroller

![scroller](screenshots/scroller.png)

Rainbow glow text bouncing over a plasma field. The plasma is baked as a
seamless loop and replayed, and the text, its tint and its glow are baked once
into one wide strip, so each frame is a couple of slices. The bounce is
applied in *screen* space, not text space — a text-space wave travels with the
letters and just slides rigidly.

Expect a few seconds of black at startup while it bakes; `--plasma-frames`
trades loop length for startup time.

```console
$ python3 scroller.py --text "GREETZ  " --amp 16 --no-plasma
```

### headroom

![headroom](screenshots/headroom.png)

Max Headroom: a plasticky head in dark glasses stuttering in front of a
backdrop of neon stripes that rotates and recedes. The stutter is the
character, not a defect — holds, one-frame repeats, jumps back to an earlier
pose and the occasional freeze, all of them the artefacts of video that keeps
skipping, with a horizontal tear and an RGB split arriving on the glitch frames.

The room is one `np.take` from a table that packs the angle around the
vanishing point, 1/radius, the radial fade and the row parity into a single
index, so a frame is one gather rather than four trig evaluations over 20480
pixels. What that buys is also what it costs: the vanishing point cannot wander
continuously, because moving it means re-deriving `atan2` and `1/r` every
frame, so it cuts between three baked positions instead. On this material the
cuts read as deliberate camera jumps.

The head is a union of eight ellipsoids solved in closed form — the ray-ellipsoid
quadratic has an analytic nearest root, so there is no marching — baked into 20
yaw poses over about 100°, then blitted. Three of its features are painted as
bands in head space rather than built as geometry: the glasses, the hairline,
and the lit crest of the hair. That last one is what stops the hair reading as a
polished gold helmet — a single material shades smoothly however it is lit,
whereas splitting it into a lit front and an unlit swept-back mass gives the
silhouette a direction at 64 rows.

Getting it to read as plastic rather than as a mannequin took a pale, nearly
unpigmented base with the room's magenta arriving through the fill and a hard
specular carrying the surface; an earlier pass with the colour in the base
instead came out as meat.

The caption says MAX TAILSPACE, which is what a head and a room become when you
take the opposite of both halves — the sort of joke the character would have
made about himself, and it keeps the wall from claiming to be someone it is
not. `--say` takes anything; the stutter is derived from whatever it is given.

```console
$ python3 headroom.py --room acid --spin -1.5 --glitch 1
$ python3 headroom.py --say "" --side left --no-scanlines
$ python3 headroom.py --say BLIPVERT --room ice
```

### wopr

![wopr](screenshots/wopr.png)

WOPR from *WarGames*: the lamp banks thinking on the left, the Falken exchange
printing itself out on the right. Two things made the 1983 prop memorable and
neither is a graphic — the monolith's rows of amber lamps blinking against each
other with a sweep occasionally crossing a bank, and chunky phosphor capitals
arriving one at a time.

The two speakers differ by colour *and* by rhythm, which is what lets you tell
who is talking from across the room without reading a word. WOPR prints
steadily with a few percent of jitter, because it is a computer; the human's
replies are paler, sit behind a `>` prompt, run at about half the speed, and
carry real hesitation — a wide spread per keystroke and an occasional quarter
second of nothing at a word boundary. A constant interval never reads as a
person.

The lamps are 112 numbers, not 4600 pixels: each gets a baked rate, phase and
duty, so its brightness is `((t*rate + phase) % 1) < duty`, and painting the
bank is a single gather through an index map with the glow already folded into
a weight map. The chase is a gaussian in lamp-column space, one per bank, with
incommensurate speeds so the banks never line up. Two things that did *not*
work: dimming the gaps between lamp rows for the grille, since those are
already black, and letting the chase push brightness past 1.0 — the store into
uint8 is unsafe, so a lamp at 1.2 wrapped round to dark green confetti.

The script is an argument, so anyone can retype it: `;` between lines, a
leading `>` for the human. The whole exchange lands in about 35 s and then
holds, so it finishes on FINE rather than being cut off mid-sentence.

```console
$ python3 wopr.py --layout lights --colour green
$ python3 wopr.py --script 'SHALL WE PLAY A GAME?;>LOVE TO.' --cps 14
```

### defcon

![defcon](screenshots/defcon.png)

The big board from the same film, playing out an exchange: coastline in thin
glowing vector, missile tracks arcing over it, warheads blooming as expanding
rings, and a DEFCON readout stepping down while it all goes wrong. 320x64 is a
letterbox, and a letterbox is what a wall map wants to be.

**The map is real geography baked into the file** — Natural Earth 1:110m
coastline, public domain, simplified offline with Douglas-Peucker and encoded
as 81 polylines and 897 points in about 2 kB of source. Nothing is read at
runtime and nothing needs the network, which matters on a Pi that boots into
the rotation with no guarantee that anything else is reachable.

The projection is forced by the panel rather than chosen: 320 square pixels
across 360° of longitude is 1.125° a pixel, so 64 rows buy exactly 72° of
latitude. Taking that as 8°N–80°N turns out to be a gift rather than a
compromise, because that band *is* where the film's war happens — North
America, the Atlantic, Europe, Russia, China, Japan.

The map never moves, so it is rasterised once at 2x and box-filtered down; that
supersample is the whole reason the coast reads as a line rather than as a rash
of lit pixels, since a 1x Bresenham line on a 320-wide panel is either dashes
or, thickened, a blob. Per frame the demo composites into one float32
accumulator and maps it through a palette — about five whole-array passes and
no allocation. Each trajectory's pixel path is baked as a flat index array, so
a live track is six numpy calls over fifty-odd elements, and the spent tracks
that accumulate into the finale are drawn in eight pre-concatenated groups
rather than as ninety separate scatters.

It opens with tracks already in the air, because an effect that starts empty
spends its first seconds looking broken. From there the interval between
launches shrinks geometrically over the whole 80 s cycle — about one launch
every five seconds at the start, six to eight a second by the end — and flight
times shorten on the same curve, which compounds. DEFCON is derived from that
schedule rather than run off its own clock: the level drops as cumulative
launches cross fixed fractions of the total, so the countdown is a consequence
of the exchange instead of a caption over it.

Then it ends the way the film does. The impacts pile into a rising glare —
baked as one float per 1/60 s, an exponential pulse per detonation summed and
clipped, so it costs a scalar add — the board whites out, and everything goes
dark. After a beat of nothing, a block caret appears and types the line out a
character at a time:

> THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY

It reads as the machine at the other end composing it rather than as a caption
being switched on. The rhythm is a machine's — one interval wobbled five per
cent, because dead-constant timing at this size reads as a progress bar filling
and anything more uneven reads as a person at the keyboard, which is the wrong
character — with a beat where a terminal would return the carriage and a longer
one before the last word. The caret is solid while it writes and blinks only
once the line is finished; a caret that blinks *through* the typing looks like a
fault. The whole performance is capped at 55% of the phase and scales down
uniformly if it will not fit, so a long `--message` or a short `--cycle` types
faster rather than being cut off mid-word.

It is set in the same baked 3x5 pixel font as the readouts, scaled up and
wrapped to whatever fits, so there is no font file to be missing on the Pi. Then
the map fades back at DEFCON 5 and it starts again. The whiteout draws the board *under*
an additive white that dies as `(1-k)⁴`; a flat filled panel read as a fault
rather than as a detonation.

```console
$ python3 defcon.py --colour amber --arcs 10
$ python3 defcon.py --cycle 30 --speed 1.5      # hurry the war along
$ python3 defcon.py --message ""                # no epigram, longer war
```

## demoscene.py

The shared part. Each demo parses the usual options, precomputes what it can,
then hands a `render(t, frame) -> (H, W, 3)` callback to a fixed-rate loop
that pushes frames with `send_array_banded()`.

```python
import demoscene as ds

ap = ds.parser("Bouncing dot")
ap.add_argument("--radius", type=float, default=6.0)
args = ap.parse_args()

def render(t, frame):
    ...

ds.run(render, args)
```

It also carries the colour helpers, which matter more than they look. An
effect that computes one scalar per pixel and maps it through a palette is
both far cheaper than computing RGB directly and much easier to make look
good, since the palette carries the art. `gradient()` builds a lookup table
from colour stops, `rainbow()` sweeps hue, and `fire`, `ice`, `toxic` and
`magma` ship ready to use.

## Writing one that looks right on a wide panel

These effects are usually written for something squarer and taller than a
320x64 wall, and most of them need adjusting for it. Things that caught us:

- Anything with a **rate per row** — fire's cooling, for one — is tuned for a
  screen two or three times taller. Over 64 rows it never finishes, and you
  get a solid sheet of colour.
- **Shading on radius** needs scaling against the display, and on a panel this
  wide almost every pixel counts as near, so the effect flattens out. Shade on
  something in the effect's own units instead, like depth.
- A **tiled texture** must be genuinely seamless or rotation will show hard
  diagonal seams. Sine terms need whole numbers of cycles across the texture,
  and a radial term cannot tile at all.
- **Single-pixel elements** carry no weight. A near star drawn the same size
  as a far one makes a starfield read as static rather than as motion.

The frame-interval trace in [`../tools/ft-emulator`](../tools/ft-emulator) is useful
here: a stall shows up as a spike there long before it moves the average, and
stalls rather than average jitter are what read as visible flicker.

## Older Python demos

`fsa.py`, `grid.py`, `ripple.py` and `sierpinski_rain.py` predate the shared
module and use `flaschen_np.py`, a local numpy client, setting pixels
individually rather than pushing frames.
