# Demos

Effects for a FlaschenTaschen display. The Python ones here are numpy demos
that push whole frames; the C++ ones live in [`src/`](src/) and are built with
`make`.

```console
$ python3 fire.py --host 127.0.0.1
$ python3 tunnel.py --texture checker --palette magma
$ python3 metaballs.py --balls 8 --palette toxic --contour 6
```

Every demo takes `--host`, `--port`, `--width`, `--height`, `--layer`,
`--band`, `--fps` and `--duration`; `--duration` auto-stops, so a launched
stream can never become a runaway flooder. `--help` lists the rest, and most
take `--palette`.

Requirements: numpy, plus Pillow for `scroller.py`, and the `flaschen` client
from [`../api/python`](../api/python) (`pip install ./api/python`, or just run
from a clone — the demos fall back to the checkout).

No display to hand? [`../tools/ft-web`](../tools/ft-web) is a server that
renders to a browser instead of hardware, which is how the screenshots below
were taken.

## The demos

### fire

![fire](screenshots/fire.png)

Doom-style fire: a row of burning fuel along the bottom, and every frame each
cell takes the heat of the cell below it, shifted sideways at random and
cooled a little. The randomness is what turns a smooth gradient into flames.
Done as one vectorized step over the whole buffer.

```console
$ python3 fire.py --palette ice --wind -0.4 --cool 4
```

### tunnel

![tunnel](screenshots/tunnel.png)

For every pixel, the angle around the centre and a depth that grows as you
approach it, used as texture coordinates. Scrolling the depth flies you
forward; scrolling the angle rolls the tunnel. Both depend only on the pixel,
so they are computed once and each frame is two integer adds, a mask and a
gather.

```console
$ python3 tunnel.py --texture rings --speed 120 --roll -0.3
```

### starfield

![starfield](screenshots/starfield.png)

Stars drift towards the camera and are divided by their depth, so one crawls
while it is far away and then sweeps past. Each is drawn several times along
the distance it covered during the frame, which is what makes the streaks.

```console
$ python3 starfield.py --stars 800 --speed 1.6 --warp 6 --tint ice
```

### metaballs

![metaballs](screenshots/metaballs.png)

Each ball contributes a field that falls off with distance; the fields are
summed and coloured through a palette. Because the sum is smooth, two balls
approaching each other bulge and merge into one shape rather than overlapping
— which is the point, and something you cannot get by drawing circles.

```console
$ python3 metaballs.py --balls 8 --palette toxic --contour 6
```

### rotozoom

![rotozoom](screenshots/rotozoom.png)

Rotate and scale a tiled texture by working backwards: for each pixel on
screen, apply the inverse transform to find where it lands in the texture.
Every pixel then gets exactly one sample with no gaps to fill, which is why
the effect was cheap enough for hardware that could not multiply quickly.

```console
$ python3 rotozoom.py --texture xor --spin 0.35 --zoom-min 0.4
```

### scroller

![scroller](screenshots/scroller.png)

Rainbow glow text bouncing over a plasma field. The plasma is baked as a
seamless loop and replayed, and the text, its tint and its glow are baked once
into one wide strip, so each frame is a couple of slices. The bounce is
applied in *screen* space, not text space — a text-space wave travels with the
letters and just slides rigidly.

Expect a few seconds of black at startup while it bakes; `--plasma-frames`
trades loop length for startup time.

```console
$ python3 scroller.py --text "GREETZ  " --amp 16 --no-plasma
```

## demoscene.py

The shared part. Each demo parses the usual options, precomputes what it can,
then hands a `render(t, frame) -> (H, W, 3)` callback to a fixed-rate loop
that pushes frames with `send_array_banded()`.

```python
import demoscene as ds

ap = ds.parser("Bouncing dot")
ap.add_argument("--radius", type=float, default=6.0)
args = ap.parse_args()

def render(t, frame):
    ...

ds.run(render, args)
```

It also carries the colour helpers, which matter more than they look. An
effect that computes one scalar per pixel and maps it through a palette is
both far cheaper than computing RGB directly and much easier to make look
good, since the palette carries the art. `gradient()` builds a lookup table
from colour stops, `rainbow()` sweeps hue, and `fire`, `ice`, `toxic` and
`magma` ship ready to use.

## Writing one that looks right on a wide panel

These effects are usually written for something squarer and taller than a
320x64 wall, and most of them need adjusting for it. Things that caught us:

- Anything with a **rate per row** — fire's cooling, for one — is tuned for a
  screen two or three times taller. Over 64 rows it never finishes, and you
  get a solid sheet of colour.
- **Shading on radius** needs scaling against the display, and on a panel this
  wide almost every pixel counts as near, so the effect flattens out. Shade on
  something in the effect's own units instead, like depth.
- A **tiled texture** must be genuinely seamless or rotation will show hard
  diagonal seams. Sine terms need whole numbers of cycles across the texture,
  and a radial term cannot tile at all.
- **Single-pixel elements** carry no weight. A near star drawn the same size
  as a far one makes a starfield read as static rather than as motion.

The frame-interval trace in [`../tools/ft-web`](../tools/ft-web) is useful
here: a stall shows up as a spike there long before it moves the average, and
stalls rather than average jitter are what read as visible flicker.

## Older Python demos

`fsa.py`, `grid.py`, `ripple.py` and `sierpinski_rain.py` predate the shared
module and use `flaschen_np.py`, a local numpy client, setting pixels
individually rather than pushing frames.
