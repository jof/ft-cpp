"""Megademo: play the effects back to back as one continuous show.

This is the sequencer. It owns no effect of its own; it takes a playlist of
(effect, seconds, options) and drives the other demo modules through it,
blending one into the next instead of cutting.

  python3 megademo.py --host 127.0.0.1
  python3 megademo.py --playlist fire:20,tunnel:15:wipe,starfield:12
  python3 megademo.py --duration 60 --transition 1.5 --no-banner

Three things make this work:

  * demoscene.build(module) separates setup from the frame loop, so a render
    callback can be constructed without running anyone's loop. Two effects can
    therefore be alive and rendering at the same time, which is what a real
    transition needs.

  * The effect list is DATA (the PLAYLIST below), not code. Adding an
    effect to the show is adding its name to a list; modules are imported
    lazily by name and any that is missing from the checkout is skipped with a
    warning, so this runs on a tree where half the effects do not exist yet.

  * Builds happen on a background thread, a couple of segments ahead of the
    playhead. scroller.build() bakes for several seconds; doing that inline at
    the moment of the transition would freeze the wall, and doing every build
    up front would mean a slow start and every effect's tables resident at
    once. Building just ahead costs one worker thread and keeps two or three
    effects in memory, which is the trade a Pi 3 wants.

Transitions vary rather than repeating one throughout, because there is no
soundtrack to carry the pacing: a wipe between two textured effects, a fade
through black when the show goes from busy to sparse, a crossfade otherwise.

Needs numpy, Pillow (for the banner only), and the `flaschen` client from
../api/python.

# The show, as data.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Effects that put a few bright things on mostly black. The transition picker
# uses this: fading through black reads well going to or from one of these,
# where a wipe or crossfade mostly just looks like a smear.
#
# The data panels are all here, and by a slightly different argument than the
# effects are: they are not sparse so much as *read*. Measured on the shipped
# screenshots, `propagation` lights 27% of its pixels and `winds` lights 86%,
# and it is the first of those that needs the black fade -- because what makes
# it fail is a busy neighbour blended over small type, not brightness. Anything
# carrying a number somebody is meant to come away with belongs in this set.
#
# Which is the same test the nostalgia panels are in on: a scan log and a BBS
# screen are type, and toasters is a handful of sprites on black. gibson is
# deliberately absent -- once its towers became filled glass it stopped being a
# few thin lines and became one of the densest things in the show.
#
# The six panels added after it each came with a density measurement and a
# recommendation, and five of the six recommended staying out of this set on
# the grounds that they light too much of the panel. That is the effects test,
# not the data test, and the paragraph above is the reason they are in anyway:
# `swell` fills its middle band edge to edge but the thing you are meant to
# leave with is "5.2FT 9S NW", `helicorder` is quiet ribbons around a µm/s
# figure, and `bgp` is a wall of green under a prefix rate. Every one of them
# is a number over a picture, which is exactly what a crossfade ruins.
