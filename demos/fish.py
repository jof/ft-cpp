"""An aquarium. Just fish.

Every other panel on this wall is trying to tell you something. This one is
not. It is a tank: a big slow one crossing the whole panel while a cloud of
tiny ones flickers around it, weed swaying at the bottom, bubbles going up in
irregular strings, light rippling from above. There is nothing to read and
nothing to learn, which in a loud workshop is worth more than another chart.

Three things carry it, and everything else is furniture.

**The fish are analytic, not sprites that were drawn.** A fish is a centre line
and a half-height, both functions of one coordinate `u` running from the tail
tip to the nose. The swimming motion is a travelling sine added to the *centre
line* -- amplitude growing towards the tail, phase running head to tail -- so
the body flexes rather than sliding. That is the entire animation, and because
the wave is baked into the shape rather than applied to finished pixels, a
tail-beat frame costs nothing at run time: build() rasterises six phases and
render() picks one.

**A fish that turns is a fish that gets narrower.** The horizontal path is
`cx + Ax*(sin θ + a bit of sin 3θ)`, so velocity is `cos`-shaped: the fish
decelerates into the edge, hangs, and comes back. To *see* that as a turn
rather than as a reversal, each fish is also baked at several horizontal
squashes, and the frame picks one from the sign and size of dx/dt. Full
profile while cruising, a sliver head-on at the turn. It is the cheapest
possible three-quarter view and it is most of the character.

**Depth is sort order and nothing else.** Every fish carries a z in 0..1 that
sets its size, its speed, how far its colour is hazed toward the water, and
where it lands in the back-to-front blit. Four or five effective planes cost
one `sort()` in build() and transform the thing.

Purity: `render` is a pure function of `t`. A shoal is naturally an update
loop, which would desync the instant the scheduler built a segment ahead, so
every path here is closed form -- a base drift plus a couple of sinusoids with
per-fish frequencies drawn once from `--seed`. The frequencies are mutually
irrational, so the tank never actually repeats; the only periodic event is the
visitor, something large and slow that wanders in every `--visitor` seconds
and leaves. The one fish that is a jerk chases by *evaluating another fish's
closed form at t minus a lag* and blending towards it, which is an interaction
without a shred of state.

Cost is sprites per frame, so `--fish` is the knob: each sprite fish is about
six numpy calls, the whole shoal is fifteen regardless of how many there are,
and the tank around them is thirty.
