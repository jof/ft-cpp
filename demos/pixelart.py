"""Sprite sheets from pixelart/, the way the C `grayscale` tool played them.

The Sequoia Fabrica wall has been showing this artwork for a couple of years:
a sequoia, space invaders, pacman and his ghosts, and an eight-frame sewing
machine. It was played by an external binary reading JSON files of hex
strings, which meant it could never blend into the effect either side of it,
could never be previewed, and had to be pointed at absolute paths on one Pi.
This is the same artwork as a demoscene module.

Two ways to lay a set of sprites out, which is the distinction the old tool
drew with its -D flag:

  strip      the sprites are joined side by side into one wide image and moved
             across the panel as a unit. Four invaders in a row, seven
             sequoias marching past.
  sequence   the sprites are frames of one animation, played in place. The
             sewing machine and pacman's chomp.

and a third that is both at once. --poses names alternative sheets of the same
slots, so a strip can hold four different sprites and still animate, every one
of them changing pose together. That is how an arcade cabinet did it and it is
what stops a row of invaders reading as a printed banner.

Then three ways to place the result: centred, bouncing, or scrolling. Bounce
is the one worth having on a 320x64 panel -- a strip wider than the screen
that turns around at each end reads as deliberate, where a strip that wraps
reads as a seam going past. A scroll needs --travel to match whichever way the
artwork faces.

Colour is either the artwork's own, or its brightness mapped through a palette.
The old tool defaulted to the latter and that is how the sequoia has always
looked on this wall: a rainbow-shaded tree, not a green one.

Run:  python3 pixelart.py --art sf-tree --mode center
      python3 pixelart.py --art sew1..8 --sequence-ms 120
      python3 pixelart.py --art pacman-32x32-1..6 --sequence-ms 50 \
              --mode scroll --travel right
      python3 pixelart.py --art space-invaders-1..4 --poses ,b \
              --sequence-ms 500 --mode bounce

    meant naming the same file seven times and for the sewing machine meant
    eight paths of forty characters. Both are ranges, so let them be written
    as ranges.

    Both range forms are bounded, and the reason is worth writing down. This
    string arrives from the panel over HTTP, and the number inside it is the
    one part of an option `ftsched_opts.check` cannot see: it clamps numbers,
    and this is a str. Unbounded, `--art "sf-tree*100000000"` asks for about
    eight hundred megabytes on a machine whose cgroup stops at 512 MB -- which
    is not a MemoryError anybody can catch. The kernel kills the process,
    systemd restarts it, and the option has already been persisted to
    state.json, so it dies again on the way up and stays dead until somebody
    edits JSON over SSH. A ValueError, by contrast, is a build that fails
