"""Aircraft over the Bay, live, moving the way they are actually moving.

A map of the Bay Area with everything airborne within fifty nautical miles of
the wall drawn on it as a short comet: the head is where the aircraft is, the
tail is where it came from, the length is how fast it is going and the colour
is how high it is -- warm on the deck, cool in the flight levels. The two most
interesting of them are named. Underneath, the counts, the altitude ramp the
colours come off, and how old the data is.

**Sixty-second-old data that does not look sixty seconds old.** The fetcher
asks once a minute; sixty stationary dots that jump every minute would look
broken, and would also be a worse picture than the truth, because ADS-B carries
a groundspeed and a track and those are enough to say where an aircraft is
*now*. So `render()` dead-reckons: each aircraft advances along its own track
at its own groundspeed from the moment its position was last heard, which is a
per-aircraft number and not the age of the fetch -- a jet over the Gate reports
twice a second and something over the Diablo range may not have been heard for
half a minute. When a new record lands it does not snap; the correction is
eased in over about a second, so a fix that has moved a plane three pixels
looks like a plane moving three pixels rather than like the panel glitching.
Dead reckoning is extrapolation and it is only honest for so long, which is
what the TTL is for: past five minutes the aircraft stop being drawn.

**The crop, and why it is stretched three times.** 37.47-37.93 N,
122.94-121.86 W: 95 km by 51 km, with SFO, Oakland, Hayward, San Carlos and
Half Moon Bay on it, the Golden Gate at the top and the wall's own address in
the middle. Drawn across 320 columns and 57 rows that is a three-fold
horizontal stretch, the same one tide.py applies to the Gate corridor and for
the same reason: the Bay Area is roughly square and the panel is five times
wider than it is tall, so something has to give. San Jose is deliberately off
the bottom -- reaching it costs another quarter of stretch for an airport whose
traffic mostly never comes near this building. The stretch is applied to the
velocities as well as to the positions, so a mark points along the direction it
is really travelling *on this map*; it is not a compass rose and does not
pretend to be one.

**The coastline is `adsb-coast.npz`, and it is not `voxel-dem.npz`.** The DEM
the voxel and tide demos share stops at 37.635 N, and SFO is at 37.619 -- a mile
and a half south of it. A traffic panel whose map stops just short of the
airport is not worth drawing, so `scripts/make-adsb-coast.py` bakes a second,
much wider and much coarser mask: three times the area, an eighth of the
resolution, one bit a cell, 5 kB. Land is dim, water is darker, the shoreline
is lit, and nothing else on the map is bright, because the aircraft are the
only thing on it that is news.

**Nothing here touches the network.** `ftdata.py` fetches on a timer in a
process of its own; this demo reads the file it leaves behind and does not
import a HTTP library. It has to be that way round -- the scheduler builds the
next segment on a worker thread, Python threads share the GIL, and a `build()`
blocked on a socket stops the render loop getting the interpreter back. This
product wants a minute's cadence rather than fifteen:

    $ python3 ftdata.py --loop 60 --due --fast

**The frame budget is 50 ms**, which is a 20 fps segment on the wall's Pi 3 at
its throttled 600 MHz. Everything that can be baked is baked in `build()`: the
coastline, the airports, the scale bar, the status strip, the altitude colour
of every aircraft and the unit vector it flies along. A frame is one full-frame
copy, four array operations to advance every aircraft at once, four scatters to
draw them and two labels -- about thirty numpy calls whether there is one
aircraft or a hundred and twenty, which is the number that matters on a machine
where a bare numpy call costs 55-80 us regardless of the size of the array.
Measured on this desktop over 600 sequential frames: **p95 0.054 ms with 31
aircraft and 0.096 ms with the cap's full 120**, and `build()` is 3 ms cold
against voxel's 8.2 s. At the 76-114x this project keeps measuring between this
desktop and that Pi, the busy case is 7-11 ms, and the floor set by the call
count alone -- thirty calls at 80 us -- is 2.4 ms, so the two agree and neither
is close to 50. The standalone default is still 20 fps rather than 30: nothing
here moves faster than three pixels a second, so the other ten frames carry no
information.
