"""The ground, in a city that thinks about it.

Two maps and a number. On the left, the greater Bay Area at about 1.4 km to the
pixel, with the water filled, the eight strands of the plate boundary that run
through it, and every earthquake USGS located there in the last week. In the
middle, the same week out to 300 km, which is where Parkfield, the Mendocino
triple junction and the rest of the ground that shakes this city but has none
of its address live. On the right, the number the room actually wants: **how
many days since the last M4 within 100 km**, and which one that was.

**Most days this panel is nearly empty, and that is the answer.** A quiet week
is a scatter of one- and two-pixel dots around the Geysers and a long count of
days on the right, and that has to read as an instrument working rather than an
instrument broken. So the empty state is the designed one: the faults and the
coast are drawn whether or not anything happened on them, the count of days is
large type because a large number there is good news, the most recent event --
however small -- breathes once a second so the panel is visibly live, and the
word in the header is `QUIET`, which is a statement and not a shrug. There is
no state in which this demo shows nothing; there is only the state in which the
ground has done nothing, which looks quite different.

**And it has to become loud when something happens.** An M4+ within the last
six hours, an M5+ within a day, or an M6+ within three days takes the panel
over: the header turns red and blinks, the right-hand column becomes that one
earthquake -- magnitude in the largest type on the wall, place, distance and
bearing from this building, depth, how long ago -- and rings expand out of the
epicentre across whichever map it landed on. It is tested with a synthetic M5.8
written into a cache, because the alternative is waiting.

**Magnitude is logarithmic, and the marker is not scaled by it.** Scaling a
marker by magnitude directly gives an M6 twice the radius of an M3 for thirty
thousand times the energy, which is a lie in the flattering direction; scaling
by energy gives every M2 a radius of 10^-8 pixels, which is a lie in the other.
So the marker is not a symbol for the number at all -- it is drawn at **the size
of the ground that broke**, on the map's own scale. Wells & Coppersmith give
subsurface rupture length for a strike-slip event as log10(L) = 0.59 M - 2.44,
so the marker's radius is L/2 in kilometres, projected like everything else on
the map. An M7 is then 25 km across and dominates the panel, which is correct;
Loma Prieta comes out at 21 km of radius against a real rupture around 40 km
long, which is the right answer to within the width of a pixel. Below about
M4.5 the rupture is smaller than a pixel, so those get a floor of one pixel and
their magnitude is carried by **colour** instead -- a blue-to-red ramp -- and
their age by **brightness**, fading to about a quarter over the seven-day
window, with a white core on anything in the last hour. Three channels for
three quantities, and the one that is genuinely enormous is the one drawn to
scale.

**The Bay map is stretched, and there is no version of this that is not.** The
squash of a tile is fixed by arithmetic: it is the region's height-to-width
ratio times the tile's width-to-height ratio, so on a tile 155 by 57 a square
region is squashed 2.7 times whatever you do, and the only free choices are how
much ground to cover and where the distortion goes. The Bay tile covers
37.20-38.85 N, 121.15-123.55 W -- 210 km east to west, 183 north to south --
and comes out squashed 2.4 times vertically, at 1.36 km to the pixel across and
3.2 km down. Everything on it is squashed equally, including the rupture discs,
which is why a large event draws as a flat ellipse and not a circle; the ellipse
is the true shape on this projection. The 300 km tile is the opposite: 57 by 57
over a 620 x 600 km box, which is within 4% of true scale, and it carries range
rings at 100 and 300 km so the eye has something to measure against.

That extent is itself a trade. A tight crop of the Bay is a better-looking map
and, most weeks, an empty one: the busiest ground in northern California is the
Geysers geothermal field at 38.79 N, 60 km north of any crop that keeps the Bay
looking like the Bay, and it alone supplies half the week's local events.
Reaching up to it costs half a unit of squash and buys the map its earthquakes.

The geography is baked into this file rather than fetched or shipped as a
sidecar: a 1-bit water mask per tile, rasterised offline from the Natural Earth
1:10m ocean polygons, and eight fault traces from the USGS 2014 National Seismic
Hazard Model. See the note above them for why the water is a mask and not a
coastline -- the short version is that at this squash a drawn coastline has no
inside and no outside, and a filled bay is recognisable across a workshop.

**Nothing here touches the network.** `build()` calls `ftdata.load()` and
nothing else; `render()` touches neither disk nor socket. It has to be that way
round -- `ftsched` builds the next segment on a worker thread, Python threads
share the GIL, and a `build()` blocked on a socket stops the render loop getting
the interpreter back. Run the fetcher:

    $ python3 ftdata.py --loop 900

**Age is part of the data.** The fetch age is in the header in ftdata's short
form, it turns amber past the TTL, and past three TTLs the panel stops drawing
earthquakes altogether and says so -- an hour-old catalogue is fine, a day-old
one is a map of a city where nothing has happened since yesterday, which is a
different and much worse claim. No file at all gets the no-data card with the
command that fixes it.

**The frame budget is 50 ms**, which is what 20 fps costs on a Pi 3 held at
600 MHz. Almost nothing happens per frame: the maps, the type, the events and
the sparkline are rasterised in `build()` into one uint8 frame, and `render()`
copies it and repaints the pulse, the heartbeat and -- when there is one -- two
expanding rings. Measured over 400 sequential frames on this desktop that is
**p50 0.006 ms, p95 0.007 ms** quiet and **p50 0.035, p95 0.037** with an alert
on screen, the difference being the two ring masks over a whole tile. At the
76-114x this project keeps measuring between here and the wall, call it 0.8 ms
and 4 ms on the Pi. Neither is close to the budget and neither is the thing to
watch.

**The thing to watch is the rebake**, which is the one place this could still
stutter. Re-reading the cache and redrawing three hundred events across two
maps costs 3.4 ms here and therefore something like 350 ms on the wall -- seven
dropped frames, in one lump. Two things keep it off the panel. It only happens
when the record has actually changed, which is checked with an `os.stat` and
not by parsing 58 kB of JSON; on a ten-minute product that is once per ten
minutes at worst and usually never during a segment. And the biggest single
cost in it turned out to be `np.clip` on a scalar inside the colour lookup,
called six thousand times a rebake for 3.3 of the original 5.3 ms, which is now
a list index -- see MAG_TABLE.

# The geography, baked.
#
# **Water as a mask, not as a coastline.** The first version of this drew the
# Natural Earth coastline as a polyline and it was unreadable: at this squash
# the Bay, Suisun Bay and the Delta become a horizontal scribble of thin lines
# with no inside and no outside, and the eye cannot tell a channel from a
# fault. Filled water is recognisable at a glance and the shoreline falls out
# of it for free -- dilate the mask and subtract it, exactly as tide.py does.
#
# So each tile carries a 1-bit water mask, rasterised offline from the Natural
# Earth 1:10m ocean polygons at 8x8 supersampling and thresholded at half a
# pixel of water, packed with np.packbits and base64'd. The Bay tile's is
# 150x57 = 1069 bytes and the region tile's is 421; the pair costs about
# thirty lines of source, which is cheaper than a sidecar file that can go
# missing and much cheaper than a vector fill at run time. A canvas that is not
# 320x64 gets the mask nearest-resampled, which is the same thing every other
# demo here does with its geography.
#
# The faults are the eight principal strands of the USGS 2014 National Seismic
# Hazard Model fault sections (hazfaults2014) -- the seismogenic model rather
# than the Quaternary fault map: fewer, longer, and the ones that carry the
# slip. There are 74 sections in this box; drawing all of them is a grey smear
# and drawing these eight is a plate boundary. They are very nearly straight,
# so eight systems cost 42 points between them, as (lon, lat) in GeoJSON order.
